        <title>Should you contribute to open-source software? &lt;em&gt;It's complicated&lt;/em&gt;.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following article is the foundation for a 2019 Drupal GovCon session in the Business + Community track entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupalgovcon.org/2019/program/sessions/should-you-contribute-open-source-its-complicated&quot;&gt;“Should you contribute to open source? It’s complicated.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
___&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s true that the &lt;em&gt;act of contributing&lt;/em&gt; to open-source software (OSS) is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-makes-it-difficult-for-you-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project&quot;&gt;complicated&lt;/a&gt;. Having the requisite skills to perform the work and the time to navigate a community are substantial barriers, to name just two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever the fan of double entendres, I believe that whether OSS contribution is the &lt;em&gt;best usage of time and skill&lt;/em&gt; for professionals who work in OSS (read: &lt;a href=&quot;https://sdtimes.com/os/open-source-at-20-the-ubiquity-of-shared-code/&quot;&gt;everyone&lt;/a&gt;) is &lt;em&gt;also complicated&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my career (all in OSS, excluding my high school &lt;em&gt;sandwich artist&lt;/em&gt; days), my colleagues have held near unanimity that it’s in the organization’s best interest to contribute back to the OSS tools it uses. They’ve typically advocated doing so during company time (for brevity’s sake, from here on, I’ll refer to this as “flex time”). Beyond my anecdote, the data also show that a &lt;a href=&quot;https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#developer-profile-_-contributing-to-open-source&quot;&gt;majority of software developers contribute&lt;/a&gt; at least occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the sections to follow, we’ll briefly look at the OSS ecosystem, analyzing both the motivations that drive and the barriers that challenge the highly-skilled individuals and organizations who contribute to OSS. We’ll also take a look at &lt;em&gt;some alternatives&lt;/em&gt; to OSS contribution with how to our limited (flex) time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-open-source-software-oss-contribution&quot;&gt;What Is Open-source Software (OSS) Contribution?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Redhat (who runs opensource.com and whose &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps?q=100EDavieSt,Raleigh,NC,27601&quot;&gt;HQ&lt;/a&gt; is in our backyard)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few examples of popular OSS projects that you’re perhaps familiar with (at least one of which you’re using right now) are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chromium.org/&quot;&gt;Google Chrome Browser&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/&quot;&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; CMS and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; static site generator, the platform for the Savas website (at the time of writing this). In fact, much of the foundation of the internet is OSS. Anyone who has the requisite expertise can modify such programs; the access is free. Whether or not those modifications qualify as “enhancements,” much like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opposite end of the spectrum is closed-source software, which is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; publicly available to be modified and is almost always exclusively licensed by the company that owns and protects the proprietary code to consumers and businesses who use the product. A couple of examples of closed-source software that you may be familiar with are Adobe Creative Suite and Microsoft Office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successful OSS projects are highly utilized, and by design, foster substantial collaboration causing robust and complex communities to form around them. Let’s look at the stakeholders in those communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;oss-stakeholders&quot;&gt;OSS Stakeholders&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;blog-image-full-width&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Warren Buffet holding a steak, get it?&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/steak-holder.jpg&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Memegenerator.com&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two fundamental stakeholders that comprise the contributors to an OSS community: individuals and organizations. Organizations are naturally comprised of individuals. Individuals either work for an organization that uses the OSS tools or represent themselves. When not employed by a company, individuals are either hobbyists or what I would argue is the more sustainable of the two, self-employed freelancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizations and individuals have some nuanced distinctions in their motivations and how they behave within OSS communities. A single contributor’s motivations can range from entirely self-promotional to solely altruistic, which depends largely on the individual and their circumstances. An organization’s incentives tend to be more systematic and structured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;individual-stakeholders-and-their-motivations&quot;&gt;Individual Stakeholders And Their Motivations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;blog-image-full-width&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Richard Simmons pointing like only he can&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/richard-simmons-motivation.jpg&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Richard Simmons @ Reed College motivational AF&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many things motivate us in the workplace; some irrespective of the type of work, while others are inextricably linked to it. We humans have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-need-to-belong-2795393&quot;&gt;deep desire to belong&lt;/a&gt; to a group, to be included, to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/onbeing/alain-de-botton-the-true-hard-work-of-love-and-relationships-aug2018#t=39:08&quot;&gt;accepted&lt;/a&gt;. For many individuals, this undergirds at least some of their motivation to contribute to an OSS project, and by extension, to become part of a community. Contribution can also positively influence one’s career opportunities by demonstrating proficiency publicly with a particular tool. Developing a professional network with other OSS professionals within the community can also be advantageous and complements the skills gained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, as Daniel Pink expresses in his seminal book Drive (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thersa.org/discover/videos/rsa-animate/2010/04/rsa-animate---drive#&quot;&gt;cartoon-animated with a sharpie if you prefer&lt;/a&gt;), significant motivations for knowledge workers across industries are &lt;strong&gt;autonomy&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;mastery&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;purpose&lt;/strong&gt;. In the best of circumstances, OSS contribution can check all three of these boxes if the contributor has some control over what they’re going to contribute. This Harvard Business School report exemplifies the demonstration of mastery:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Companies that contribute and give back learn how to better use the open source software in their own environment. &lt;span&gt;Frank Nagle - HBS - &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/the-hidden-benefit-of-giving-back-to-open-source-software&quot;&gt;The Hidden Benefit of Giving Back to Open Source Software&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A local favorite of mine, behavioral economist Dan Ariely, demonstrates the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_ariely_what_makes_us_feel_good_about_our_work/transcript?language=en&quot;&gt;importance of “purpose”&lt;/a&gt;, which he refers to as “meaning” in experiments he’s conducted targeting knowledge workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;organization-stakeholders-and-their-motivations&quot;&gt;Organization Stakeholders And Their Motivations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, organizations share motivations with individuals as they are a collective of them, or in the case of a U.S. corporation, a &lt;em&gt;very powerful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYclXJTRzqU&quot;&gt;person&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, if you prefer. I don’t. However, I’ll focus on the motivations that are unique to organizations for the sake of comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An organization looks at self-preservation differently than an individual. An individual needs to eat, drink, sleep, and be be loved. An organization, to keep its doors open, has to do things like marketing, sales, recruiting, and the like. For agencies like ours who work with OSS, but whose business model is to serve clients, OSS contribution — not merely leveraging OSS in a build, but true contribution to a core project — requires either volunteer time, or company dedicated flex time to do the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RMtnDaxmPw&quot;&gt;deep work&lt;/a&gt; of OSS contribution. There are rare opportunities in which project work fits well with an OSS contribution, but this is typically a serendipitous exception, not the norm. The flex time does not bring in revenue directly, so it represents a short-term opportunity cost to the organization of someone’s (usually a developer’s) time. The question is, is the investment worth it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;oss-contribution-marketing-and-sales-benefits-substantiated&quot;&gt;OSS Contribution Marketing And Sales Benefits. Substantiated?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizations may market OSS contribution as conferring a competitive advantage but, IMCO (correct), that advantage is often overstated. Differentiating one’s organization from its competitors &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the world of marketing and sales, and is just the game we all play. Try this overzealous marketing statement on for size that I referenced in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/sessions/total-value-ownership-drupal-8-and-beyond&quot;&gt;Drupalcon talk in 2016&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At Chapter Three, our dedicated team of experts helped to build Drupal 8, and we are helping port modules to Drupal 8 daily. Our investment in Drupal 8 has given us unprecedented access to the latest Drupal 8 techniques and put us lightyears ahead of others agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a touch too braggadocious? I’d be curious to know how that worked out for them. Also, “light years”: two words, and is, of course, a measure of distance, so I’m not sure exactly &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; that puts them on the map, but seemingly not “&lt;em&gt;light years&lt;/em&gt;” ahead in grammar compared to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/savaslabs/savaslabs.github.io/blob/source/hooks/pre-commit#L45-L63&quot;&gt;“others agencies”&lt;/a&gt; ;)  &lt;a href=&quot;https://us2.campaign-archive.com/?u=84a5d97487adda9f8f52224e2&amp;amp;id=04a3ce3d49&amp;amp;e=83a6cb0714&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/rant&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Partial dig notwithstanding, we appreciate your support in making Drupal 8 better &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chapterthree.com/&quot;&gt;Chapter 3&lt;/a&gt; – we undoubtedly benefited from your work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediacurrent.com/blog/why-should-companies-support-drupal/&quot;&gt;others in our industry, like Mediacurrent&lt;/a&gt;, do &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediacurrent.com/blog/how-organizations-can-give-back-open-source-projects-and-why/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; as well (including &lt;a href=&quot;/results/open-source/&quot;&gt;us&lt;/a&gt;). Like Chapter Three, Mediacurrent is also well known in the Drupal community as a perennial contributor, and I have a lot of respect for them as an organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While contribution demonstrates &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; skill with a tool, it is only on rare occasions that a specific OSS contribution is a meaningful distinction – decision-makers who determine what consultant to hire for a project usually don’t have the experience to understand what the OSS contribution represents and, in most cases, do not care. Rather, OSS contribution is part of a whole package of being a good standing digital corporate citizen, but it’s rarely the chief decision-maker in a sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;oss-contribution-recruiting-impact&quot;&gt;OSS Contribution Recruiting Impact&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;companies that pay employees to contribute to open source are improving their image and, potentially, their ability to recruit top talent. &lt;span&gt;Frank Nagle - HBS - &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/the-hidden-benefit-of-giving-back-to-open-source-software&quot;&gt;The Hidden Benefit of Giving Back to Open Source Software&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the knowledge economy, an organization’s most valuable resource is its people, and providing the opportunity to contribute helps with employee satisfaction (and therefore, retention) for the contributor. Savas Labs has had the chance to &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/tag/team/&quot;&gt;grow throughout 2019 consistently&lt;/a&gt;. With that fortune, I have spent a fair amount of time conversing with applicants, a majority of whom express an interest in the opportunity to contribute to OSS and that they appreciate &lt;a href=&quot;/results/open-source/&quot;&gt;how we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; that at Savas&lt;/a&gt;. So, it stands to reason, to remain a competitive workplace, it has become somewhat of an expectation that OSS contribution is part of company time. Marketing these contributions entices future applicants, which can be tremendously valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would argue (I am, quite cogently I might add) that, recruiting, employee satisfaction, and retention confer the most significant organizational benefits from flex time OSS contribution. Existing and prospective team members &lt;em&gt;do understand&lt;/em&gt; OSS and are intrigued by an environment that will help them contribute to it for all the reasons mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;oss-contribution-financial-impact&quot;&gt;OSS Contribution Financial Impact&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing we’ve learned from Pink is that people aren’t as professionally motivated by money as we might think they are. When the work requires at least “rudimentary cognitive skill,” an individual tends to focus on other emotionally fulfilling aspects of their work. In most cases, OSS contributors within a company don’t see much difference in their compensation regardless of the amount of time given for contribution. Organizations, however, typically have more financially-oriented goals and have a greater onus to serve their stakeholders (employees, owners, and investors). Therefore, necessarily, they need to focus on money more than individuals do. To “take the issue of money off the table” as Pink suggests, those of us who run organizations need to be financially competent and transparent so that finances are not an issue non-owning team members need to worry about. All this to say, there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; challenges to striking a healthy balance of company flex time, and it is of utmost importance for organizations to justify the return on investment from a host of perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges-to-oss-contribution&quot;&gt;Challenges To OSS Contribution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all things in life not created equally, the ability to contribute to OSS is no exception. To his credit and admitting to the errors of his previous oversight (with some assistance from the diversity and inclusion team, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/7rbUyv3hYDc?t=307&quot;&gt;others he’s employed&lt;/a&gt;), the creator of Drupal, Dries Buytaert, writes well to the fact that &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/the-privilege-of-free-time-in-open-source&quot;&gt;OSS contribution is a tremendously privileged activity&lt;/a&gt;.  Therefore, who gets to contribute is not evenly distributed in society, and neither are the advantages that come along with having those public contributions to reference. Others have said it well in the past:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It takes time and mentorship to contribute to open source, and not everyone has those two things. &lt;span&gt;Mark Lavin @ All Things Open 2015 then of Caktus Group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, I’ve referenced three other (white) men talking about privilege. Noted :thinking:.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewers – the Savas Labs recruiting team is no exception – will often ask about, and certainly search for without asking, public proof of expertise. OSS contributions are the most common and relevant bits of this information. It is a data point that we’ve learned to appreciate the embedded privilege that may be associated with it and judge accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;if-not-oss-contribution-then-what-are-the-alternatives&quot;&gt;If not OSS contribution, then what are the alternatives?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our profession, we must continuously prioritize how to best use our limited time in a way that’s most rewarding to the relevant stakeholders to our organization: our team members, partners, and depending on your perspective, to society at large. This is the area I probably spend the most time thinking about, and yet also seems to be the most challenging from which to derive clarity. Many others have been thinking about these things for a long time as well. Here are a few approaches out there:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implement a volunteer day&lt;/strong&gt;: We’ve recently added a Community Service day to our company benefits. This a good way to empower people with the autonomy to give back in however they see most fit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start an innovation lab&lt;/strong&gt;: Our neighbors and good friends one block to the north, Viget, instituted something they call “&lt;a href=&quot;https://pointlesscorp.com/&quot;&gt;Pointless Corp&lt;/a&gt;” in which, when team members have flex time, they may choose to build useful or fun projects &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.viget.com/articles/making-things-just-because/&quot;&gt;just because&lt;/a&gt;, in their case, with a unique brand of “pointless” irreverence. While clearly not aiming for Pink’s &lt;strong&gt;purpose&lt;/strong&gt; of the three main drivers for knowledge workers, Pointless Corp provides Vigeters an opportunity to develop &lt;strong&gt;mastery&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;autonomously&lt;/strong&gt;. As a wise,  Meatloaf once said, yes, the same Meatloaf who &lt;em&gt;would do anything for love&lt;/em&gt;: “two out of three ain’t bad.” Such &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5hWWe-ts2s&quot;&gt;passion :cupid: that Meatloaf!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide autonomous structure&lt;/strong&gt;: Our neighbors and good friends one block to the south, thoughtbot, have something they call “&lt;a href=&quot;https://thoughtbot.com/playbook/our-company/time&quot;&gt;investment time&lt;/a&gt;” in which they give their team members guidance on what to do within some parameters, but it’s primarily up to the team member to decide what they’ll work on. They dedicate their entire Friday each week (with few exceptions) to investment time. This commitment is impressive, and as far as I can tell from speaking to their team members, something they really appreciate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work on pro bono projects&lt;/strong&gt;: In other words, providing consultation and services for free for a mission-driven organization or one that has limited resources (often a nonprofit). These projects can be highly beneficial to the receiving organization and can give purpose to the delivering team when the services they provide make an impact. We had a great experience with &lt;a href=&quot;/results/case-studies/pmp-civil-rights-map/&quot;&gt;Barbara Lau and the Pauli Murray Project&lt;/a&gt;. Merging the often different work styles and pace can present challenges. I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/ragtag-notes/tech-for-social-impact-6359bb241fc&quot;&gt;this resource&lt;/a&gt; provided by Ragtag, an organization whose purpose is to &lt;em&gt;“amplify progressive organizing in innovative and high-impact ways”&lt;/em&gt; on how to have a successful partnership. At Savas, we are in the process of formalizing an initiative to take on at least on pro bono project per year. More details to come in a follow-up post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you feel about these options? Does your company do something different, or do you have an idea of a good usage of flex time? Please let us know via &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4hGMEcf-m-SD4AYZhfVZXAjrVPIZTJAxBNFK9iL1Q7o-hvg/viewform&quot;&gt;this &lt;strong&gt;super short&lt;/strong&gt; survey&lt;/a&gt; or by leaving a &lt;a href=&quot;#js-comments&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll share the results in a follow-up post when we’ve collected some data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-should-you-contribute-to-open-source&quot;&gt;So, Should You Contribute To Open-Source?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s our hot take given the array of incentives, challenges, and goals of organizations and individuals on whether or not you should contribute to OSS? Well, I wouldn’t be a proper consultant if I didn’t answer this with a resounding: &lt;strong&gt;it depends&lt;/strong&gt;, now would I?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t try to be prescriptive for all individuals as to what they &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; do with their free time, but I would be remiss not to point out again that, in general, software designers and engineers are a very privileged group. If your goal is to “give back,” I would encourage you to ask yourself if those you want to help the most are other software developers and if not, how you can best use your resources to help whoever else it may be. Ultimately, OSS contribution is a good deed; sharing is caring. I have had opportunities to do sponsored OSS contribution and have also volunteered my time, though even &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; donations come with perks :eyes: :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Bicycles on shirt: ✔️ &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/crocs?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#crocs&lt;/a&gt; on swag socks for being a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@gatsbyjs&lt;/a&gt; maintainer: ✔️  Flare dialed up to 💯: ✔️ With our powers combined... it&amp;#39;s going to be a great afternoon! &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/buildwithgatsby?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#buildwithgatsby&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/6fuNuJQXX5&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/6fuNuJQXX5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Savas Labs (@SavasLabs) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SavasLabs/status/1045386497065701382?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 27, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From an organization’s perspective, it depends on your company goals. Generally speaking, if you’re able to contribute to OSS, you should. On balance, contributing to something that gives value to others for free while improving your team’s job satisfaction and career options presents a win-win for the community and the contributor. Given the importance of your people, improving happiness has &lt;a href=&quot;https://warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/new_study_shows/&quot;&gt;serious productivity implications&lt;/a&gt;, and improving recruiting quality and efficiency also have substantial payoffs, as it’s where we invest much of our time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your organization seeks to benefit society more broadly with its flex time, a goal of ours at Savas Labs, we believe there are more powerful ways to consider beyond OSS contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Savas Brings on Another Front-end Developer</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-am-i&quot;&gt;Who am I?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello Savas Labs fans! My name is &lt;a href=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/company/madeline-streilein/&quot;&gt;Madeline Streilein&lt;/a&gt;, and I am one of Savas’ two brand new Junior Front-end Developers (&lt;a href=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/company/alex-manzo/&quot;&gt;Alex Manzo&lt;/a&gt; also joined our burgeoning front-end squad under the tutelage of &lt;a href=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/company/anne-tomasevich/&quot;&gt;Anne Tomasevich&lt;/a&gt; - keep an eye out for their introduction). Some random facts about me: I love stone fruit, humidity, satirical news, and using Slack notation on all messaging platforms. I also opened a day spa in my home when I was in elementary school. It wasn’t &lt;em&gt;_not_&lt;/em&gt; profitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-did-i-come-from&quot;&gt;Where did I come from?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.projectshift.io/&quot;&gt;Project Shift&lt;/a&gt;, if you haven’t heard, is a software engineering fellowship here in Durham. I am a proud graduate of Cohort 5. Prior to Project Shift, I came from the land of electoral politics, a field that relies heavily on technology (from data analytics and predictions to voter contact and volunteer recruitment) to mobilize voters and volunteers in the days, weeks, and months leading up to an election. In my most recent role, I ran a statewide peer-to-peer texting program to get North Carolinians to the polls. I experienced first hand how thoughtful technology can catalyze civic engagement, and on the flip side, how platforms that weren’t built with the user in mind could cause enough frustration to dissuade volunteer participation and annoy an on-the-fence electorate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-am-i-choosing-to-sit-behind-a-computer-when-i-could-be-hitting-the-pavement-or-training-organizers&quot;&gt;Why am I choosing to sit behind a computer when I could be hitting the pavement or training organizers?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I ask myself, possibly more frequently than I’d prefer, what is the best use of my time and potential skills? Am I contributing enough to causes that matter? Am I contributing in a way that is actually helpful and not harmful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer at which I’ve finally arrived is this: I believe technology has the potential to alter our habits as individuals, as a society, and as a species positively, more quickly, efficiently, and sustainably than through other means of change that may come to mind. I knew I had to switch industries to help build better solutions. Using technology to maximize positive impact, I learned through the interview process, is also part of a developing vision at Savas Labs. Stay tuned for an upcoming announcement with more specific articulation of those goals from team leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-did-i-choose-savas&quot;&gt;Why did I choose Savas?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose Savas for many reasons — especially the team. I’ve seen my coworkers practice and exemplify the &lt;a href=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/company/mission-and-values/&quot;&gt;values&lt;/a&gt; we define on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://savaslabs.com&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, ones that drive me as well. How can one &lt;em&gt;_not_&lt;/em&gt; feel welcomed, empowered to excel, and ask for what they need in the onboarding process when they receive Slack messages like this from remote colleagues?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;blog-image-large&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Slack screenshot&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/savas-welcome.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Senior Project Manager, Ro Wang, greets me warmly in a private message on Slack.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My teammates bring to the table many things, in equal parts tangible and intangible, resulting in a highly productive, respectful, creative, and collaborative environment of humans who work diligently for our clients. I recognized that before I started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my last campaign wrapped up, I knew I would only be fulfilled if I went to work each day for a company that considers the community it operates within, and the unique responsibility it has to contribute (beyond the paid services it came into existence to provide). I was pleased to learn that at Savas Labs, every full-time employee is afforded one day of PTO for community service at an organization of our choosing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not as significant a factor in my job search, humor in the workplace is definitely a plus. Savas incorporates dad jokes (and other actual humor) into our weekly meetings, so I’ll just leave these here . . .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question: Why did the functional component feel lost?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer: Because it didn’t know what &lt;em&gt;state&lt;/em&gt; it was in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question:  Why did the child component have such great self-esteem?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer: Because its parent kept giving it &lt;em&gt;props&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Adventures in Estimation: Accuracy and Strategy at Savas Labs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Excellent project management starts with accurate project time estimation and is important for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accurate time estimates assist in setting milestones and managing capacity when project planning.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The accuracy (or lack thereof) of your time assessment will inform other’s perception of your reliability and competence as a project manager/company.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Time estimates almost always have a significant impact on the financial success of a project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bottom-line-time-estimations-matter-a-lot&quot;&gt;Bottom line: Time estimations matter. A lot.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s all too common to underestimate the amount of time needed for a project. Often, this is due to unanticipated challenges, requests for additional features, or unscheduled urgent tasks that occasionally pop up. Even so, estimates remain a key to success in any company—most especially ours, and we strive to keep them accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other things to keep in mind when considering estimates:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Estimates are different from proposals or contracts (read: we estimate in time, not dollars).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Estimates are not definites.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Good estimates take time, discovery, and vetting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Estimates are ultimately essential to both planning and financial success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Something to be wary of&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90313102/how-to-get-better-at-estimating-your-time&quot;&gt;The Planning Fallacy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Planning Fallacy is failing to consider how long it’s taken to complete similar tasks in the past and assuming that we won’t run into any complications that will cause delays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say, we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns–the ones we don’t know we don’t know.  &lt;span&gt;- Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a deep dive into our past time estimates (for a presentation at our recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/2019/04/08/savas-retreat-yo-self.html&quot;&gt;ReTreat Yo Self&lt;/a&gt; team retreat) and comparing to our actual spent time we concluded that as a company:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;blog-image-large&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;calculating&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/calculating.gif&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We like even numbers! (We also love a good &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome&quot;&gt;palindrome&lt;/a&gt;, hence our name).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’ve done a pretty good job, but as always, there is room for improvement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fight the planning fallacy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenge we (and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/specstimate/why-are-humans-so-bad-at-estimating-4b4290f83716&quot;&gt;the majority&lt;/a&gt;) face is the planning fallacy. So, here are a few suggestions for fighting the planning fallacy (adapted from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90313102/how-to-get-better-at-estimating-your-time&quot;&gt;this helpful article&lt;/a&gt; and my own experience):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data talks.&lt;/strong&gt; And history tends to repeat itself. So use historical data to help make the most accurate estimations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do three estimates.&lt;/strong&gt; Best-case, worst-case, and most likely. Pro tip: assume your initial estimate is “best-case.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check the calendar.&lt;/strong&gt; Take into account the big picture. What other projects will you be working on at these same times? Who will be on vacation and unable to work on the project for a week?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think in “Work Weeks.”&lt;/strong&gt; When we think of how many days we have until a project is due, we often think in actual days not in “work days.” Count only the Monday-Friday days in your estimation. More on &lt;a href=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/company/ro-wang/&quot;&gt;Ro’s&lt;/a&gt; idea of “Work Weeks” coming soon.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FUDGE it!&lt;/strong&gt; Use a fudge ratio:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Estimate the time it will take to do near-future tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Track the actual time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sum the estimates and the actual spent time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Divide the total spent time by the total estimated time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voilà! A fudge ratio! Apply that to future estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phone a friend.&lt;/strong&gt; Call on a coworker or another project manager. When estimating a project they aren’t working on, they are likely to give a far more realistic estimation than you would.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One word: RANGES&lt;/strong&gt;. Don’t estimate in perfect numbers, give a range to account for unknowns.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Started from the bottom and now…&lt;/strong&gt; Estimate at the low point of your day. That is to say, don’t do estimations when you’ve just had the most delicious lunch, your calendar is free, your inbox is near-empty, and you’re feeling high on life. You’ll be feeling over-optimistic about everything, including your time estimations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revisit&lt;/strong&gt;. After wading into a project, take a look back and revisit initial estimates. You know what they say: “measure twice, cut once.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-we-foster-estimation-success&quot;&gt;How we foster estimation success&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A project typically fits into one of two broad categories: one in which we have a high degree of familiarity, and whose scope we understand well, and those we don’t. As discussed, with the former, we use historical records to hone in tightly on the expected efforts. That’s simple. In the latter case, in which the client’s vision is not fully articulated (and this is where we provided the most value), we have learned it’s in both parties best interest to perform a strategy phase upfront. We often call it a discovery, or planning and have found it to be instrumental in getting all stakeholders the same page and reducing risk. Once we’ve elicited all the information we can from conversations with stakeholders and any relevant user testing, we then focus internally. In conjunction with the project manager, the tech lead on a given project is responsible for laying out the plan to execute the project from start to finish. Once the tech lead has produced this detailed document, we have a “designated dissenter” internal meeting in which the goal of one teammate is to pick apart any &lt;em&gt;potentially false&lt;/em&gt; assumptions (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/How-does-the-saying-about-assuming-something-go&quot;&gt;you know what they say about those&lt;/a&gt;) made by the tech lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;blog-image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;calculating&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/rbg-dissent.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This direct, constructive feedback is something that I would only consider within a team with a substantial “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/google-spent-years-studying-effective-teams-this-single-quality-contributed-most-to-their-success.html&quot;&gt;psychological safety&lt;/a&gt;,” which we &lt;a href=&quot;/company/mission-and-values/&quot;&gt;work hard to cultivate and sustain&lt;/a&gt; at Savas. The feedback is a gift that helps avoid potential future pitfalls, but a person will only hear it from someone they trust and know has shared  goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we complete the internal work, we produce one of the most beneficial outputs from the discovery process: a more detailed plan with a more accurate schedule and budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting more accurate time expectations is better for everyone because we create the necessary space—and far less anxiety and pressure—to do better quality work. It creates reliability for the client, for ourselves and our coworkers and generally keeps everything running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Savas Hires a Marketing Coordinator</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, world! (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program&quot;&gt;is that right?&lt;/a&gt;) My name is &lt;a href=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/company/jordan-nelson/&quot;&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m the newest addition to the Savas Team. I’ve joined as the Marketing Coordinator!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be working on—you guessed it—all things marketing! Blog posts (some additional exciting posts are coming very soon), social media (come say hi &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SavasLabs?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/savaslabs/?modal=admin_todo_tour&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/company/savas-labs/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), and events will be my domain. Plus some other exciting things we may have up our sleeves!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;blog-image-large&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Oh boy! This is gonna be good, I can tell. -Dory&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/oh-boy-nemo.gif&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I come from a social media/email marketing background—working in higher education admissions and marketing offices, respectively, as well as the online retail space—and I’m very excited to jump in as part of this very talented Savas Labs team. I’m working to bring you quality content from all of us, keeping you up-to-date on all things Savas and helping get the word out about the great things we do here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned quickly, that here at Savas, music preferences are taken VERY seriously (especially locally in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/durham/&quot;&gt;Durham office&lt;/a&gt;). I was warned that music was a big part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/careers/&quot;&gt;Savas culture (It’s great here—you should come work with us, too!)&lt;/a&gt; and that the “rules” include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We give &lt;em&gt;all kinds&lt;/em&gt; of music a chance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anyone can &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SavasLabs/status/1084825113080578048&quot;&gt;veto any song&lt;/a&gt; at any time, no questions asked&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We always encourage song requests/suggestions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew immediately that my first suggestion was going to make an impression on this music-loving team (and I had learned that &lt;a href=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/company/chris-russo/&quot;&gt;someone&lt;/a&gt; on the team had an affinity for pop, specifically of the 90’s/2000’s variety).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenge accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suggestion: &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/2BgEsaKNfHUdlh97KmvFyo&quot;&gt;2002 by Anne-Marie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friends, I’m so glad to report that — much like me taking the position here — it was a great choice.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Top 5 Things You Need To Know To Speak Drupal</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Oh, hello there. I’m Savas Lab’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/company/maddy-bishop-van-horn/&quot;&gt;newest project manager&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to being new to Savas, I’m also a Drupal beginner. Before joining Savas, I had experience with several other CMSes (Wordpress, Craft, Joomla!, and Umbraco, in addition to a couple of custom Rails apps.) I didn’t know much about Drupal, but I’d heard enough rumors to be a little afraid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;blog-image-large&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;The learning curve for popular CMSs&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/drupal-learning-curve.jpg&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Often shared image, source unknown.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’ve learned more about Drupal, I’ve come to appreciate that it is an incredibly powerful and flexible CMS and there’s a great community of commercial companies and volunteers who help to build and support it. My coworkers at Savas have helped me overcome the first hurdle in learning to work with Drupal: &lt;strong&gt;understanding Drupal terminology.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we dive in, I’d like to extend a huge thank you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/company/anne-tomasevich/&quot;&gt;Anne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/company/chris-russo/&quot;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt; for their mentorship and their contributions to this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;drupal-terminology&quot;&gt;Drupal Terminology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll admit it: Drupal terminology is not very intuitive. This article lists the key terms and concepts that I’ve found necessary to get started. I’ll break it into five categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drupal code&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Content&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taxonomy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Users&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Views&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-drupal-code&quot;&gt;1. DRUPAL CODE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is Drupal? When we discuss the software package itself, we usually refer to one of the three subsections of code that have specific and distinct purposes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;drupal-core&quot;&gt;Drupal Core&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The codebase that makes up the basic “core” functionality of Drupal. It’s open source and updated consistently by the Drupal community. When writing this, Drupal 8 was the latest, stable version. The move from Drupal 7 to 8 is an investment, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/2017/11/08/cost-of-drupal-7.html&quot;&gt;it’s worth it&lt;/a&gt; and represents the last time such a substantial effort will be required to upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;modules&quot;&gt;Modules&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A module is a directory of code that extends Drupal features/functionality. Drupal core comes with some modules, and many others are freely available to be downloaded. The Drupal community develops and shares these modules outside of core and they are often referred to as “contrib” (short for contributed). If needed, developers can create &lt;strong&gt;custom&lt;/strong&gt; modules for specific functionality for a given client or project. &lt;em&gt;(Wordpress translation: Modules are like plugins, although they generally require more development knowledge to install and maintain.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;themes&quot;&gt;Themes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Theme is the part of the Drupal codebase that determines how the site and its content are displayed. Theme code includes HTML markup, CSS, JavaScript, and Drupal configuration files. Savas Labs’s clients nearly always require custom theme development, and fortunately Drupal supports an efficient, sophisticated means to build off of or “extend” base themes which reduces the effort to develop and maintain custom themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-content&quot;&gt;2. CONTENT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Content refers to the copy, images, and other media that make up a website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;content-type&quot;&gt;Content type&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A collection of fields created and defined by a developer via code or a site builder via the web admin interface. Each field has a set data type, limits, and display specifications. Drupal Core comes with some basic content types, like “article” and “basic page.” Drupal core ships with a couple of basic content types and site builders may define any number of additional content types as the site requires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;node&quot;&gt;Node&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A piece of content created by a content editor. Each node has an associated content type. We can display nodes in a variety of ways across the site (we can think of it as a page, although it can be presented in other ways too. These display options are configured by developers by using &lt;strong&gt;views&lt;/strong&gt; - more on that below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Paragraph&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paragraphs are a powerful feature of Drupal 8 that did not exist in previous versions. Site builders may define Paragraph types, and they can have fields that include text, media, buttons, and more. (I repeat: paragraphs are not just for text.) I like to think of Paragraphs as components that admins can add to a &lt;strong&gt;node&lt;/strong&gt; (which, remember, we can think of as a page). Developers can add &lt;strong&gt;paragraph&lt;/strong&gt; fields to &lt;strong&gt;content types&lt;/strong&gt; to allow content editors to add a variety of &lt;strong&gt;paragraph types&lt;/strong&gt; to a node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- To be honest this seems too complex for beginners - maybe linking to a resource or having an animated GIF inline here to show what a paragraph is would go a long way to help beginners --&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;blocks&quot;&gt;Blocks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blocks are a way to put content in different regions of the site. They can be turned on and off for different pages. Take the example of a sidebar with three distinct pieces of content in it: “latest news”, “relevant content” and “ newsletter signup”. The &lt;strong&gt;region&lt;/strong&gt; would be the sidebar, and the three distinct pieces of content (“latest news”, “relevant content” and “newsletter signup”) would each be a &lt;strong&gt;block&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-taxonomy&quot;&gt;3. TAXONOMY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taxonomy is an essential and powerful part of Drupal. It is a system for classification that Drupal uses to define relationships between content. Think tags and keywords associated with a blog article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vocabulary&quot;&gt;Vocabulary&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A vocabulary is a taxonomy type. Like content types, Vocabularies are a defined collection of fields and can have visible pages, but often they do not. Vocabularies are meant to be “tags” for content rather than pieces of content themselves. However, developers can define a vocabulary using any collection of fields, so it is technically possible for a Vocabulary to show up as a page, just uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;term&quot;&gt;Term&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An item within a Vocabulary. You can think of a term as a “tag,” although they can have additional fields, as I mentioned above. &lt;strong&gt;Terms&lt;/strong&gt; are to &lt;strong&gt;Vocabularies&lt;/strong&gt; as &lt;strong&gt;nodes&lt;/strong&gt; are to &lt;strong&gt;content types&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-users&quot;&gt;4. USERS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Drupal’s strengths compared to other CMSes is its highly customizable user permissions and roles. But what does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;user&quot;&gt;User&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A user is anyone interacting with the site. Users can be &lt;strong&gt;anonymous&lt;/strong&gt; (any site visitor who is not logged in) or &lt;strong&gt;authenticated&lt;/strong&gt; (a visitor who logged in with an account).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;role&quot;&gt;Role&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A role is a defined type of user with assigned permissions. &lt;strong&gt;Anonymous&lt;/strong&gt; is one role. &lt;strong&gt;Authenticated&lt;/strong&gt; users can be given any number of defined roles, for example: “logged-in user”, “content creator”, and “administrator”. Administrators can create and customize as many roles as they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;permission&quot;&gt;Permission&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Permissions are levels of access that can be granted to roles by site administrators. Each &lt;strong&gt;role&lt;/strong&gt; can have a different view and edit permissions (e.g. “view published content”, “administer users”, “create new content”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-views&quot;&gt;5. VIEWS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drupal Views is one of the more powerful features of a Drupal site. It gives site administrators a high level of control and sophistication for grouping and presenting content across the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;views-module&quot;&gt;Views Module&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Views module allows administrators and site designers to create, manage, and display lists of content. Each list managed by the views module is known as a &lt;strong&gt;view&lt;/strong&gt;, and the output of a view is known as a &lt;strong&gt;display&lt;/strong&gt;. Admins can create displays in either block or page form, and a single view may have multiple displays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;view-mode&quot;&gt;View Mode&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;strong&gt;Views module&lt;/strong&gt;, developers can configure each &lt;strong&gt;content type&lt;/strong&gt; to have various &lt;strong&gt;view modes&lt;/strong&gt;. With view modes, admins can output a &lt;strong&gt;node&lt;/strong&gt; in a specific format with a particular set of fields. This format is known as a &lt;strong&gt;display&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a developer may make a “Preview” view mode, which will display a subset of the fields of a given &lt;strong&gt;content type&lt;/strong&gt;. By editing the fields of the node, content editors can change the content displayed in the “Preview” view mode. Another good example of a view mode that a developer may configure is a “search result” view mode, which will define, for each content type, how to display that content on the search page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good news: we made it! I won’t claim that you’re now completely fluent in Drupal, but you should have the foundation to understand and talk about the building blocks of a Drupal site with a developer or site builder.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Savas Brings On (another) Project Manager</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Faithful readers of the Savas Blog, please welcome Maddy to the Savas Team! :wave: We are so excited that she’s here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maddy comes to us from premier Digital Agency, &lt;a href=&quot;https://viget.com&quot;&gt;Viget&lt;/a&gt;, by way of &lt;a href=&quot;https://ewh.org&quot;&gt;Engineering World Health&lt;/a&gt;—a non-profit that uses the skills of students and professionals to improve health care in low-income countries. During her time there, she traveled the globe managing teams of student-engineers working on medical equipment in places like Rwanda, Nepal, and Cambodia—how awesome is that?!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;blog-image-large&quot;&gt;

 &lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;On the rim of Mt Bisoke in Rwanda (home of the mountain gorillas!)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maddy has project management skills like you wouldn’t believe and we knew she would be a perfect fit for the Savas Labs Team (&lt;a href=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/careers/&quot;&gt;Think you could be the perfect fit, too? You’re in luck, we’re hiring!&lt;/a&gt;). Her attention to detail, organizational skills, and self-motivated nature a great partner on any project and we’re excited for &lt;a href=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/results/&quot;&gt;current partners&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/services/&quot;&gt;new clients&lt;/a&gt; to get the chance to meet Maddy. We know they will be as impressed as we are!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fun fact: Maddy’s very first day on the job wasn’t from &lt;a href=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/contact/&quot;&gt;our Durham, NC office&lt;/a&gt; where she works from, but spent on a plane flying to &lt;a href=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/2019/04/08/savas-retreat-yo-self.html&quot;&gt;our latest Team Retreat&lt;/a&gt;—in Austin, Texas! Talk about an exciting first day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another fun fact about Maddy: She’s a foster dog mom. She’s making an impact in her community by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.carolinaadoptabulls.com&quot;&gt;fostering dogs&lt;/a&gt; and loving them well until (and after) they find a fur-ever home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maddy, we are glad you’re here!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ReTreat Yo' Self: A Savas Labs Team Summit</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Austin, TX March | 2019&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Periodically, the Savas Lab team gathers at a voted-upon location to work in person together, participate in team-building, and prepare for the upcoming year. Most recently we packed our bags, hopped on planes from all over (from as far away as Boston, Rapid City, Reno, and of course, Durham), and touched down in beautiful Austin, TX!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After everyone arrived, we cooked a meal together and settled in our beautiful airbnb before jumping into the two-day, action packed festivities. &lt;a href=&quot;/company/chris-russo&quot;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/company/ben-eckerson/&quot;&gt;Ben&lt;/a&gt; led breakout exercises and team sessions like “Looking Back” – which reflected on Savas Labs as a company and each of our time spent with the company so far (spoiler alert: this was &lt;strong&gt;Maddy’s FIRST DAY&lt;/strong&gt; of work with the team—what a way to start!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;blog-image-full-width&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Left: Ro leads a project management overview session for the team. Right: sticky-note ideas begin to compile as the team brainstorms the future.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/company/ro-wang&quot;&gt;Ro&lt;/a&gt; talked about the philosophy and tenants of Project Management at Savas, and how our style as a team is ever-evolving. We ended our team meetings with an exercise and discussion on personal fulfillment and work-life perspective. After a full afternoon of learning we hopped in a couple of Lyfts and headed to a quick dinner at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yelp.com/search?cflt=foodtrucks&amp;amp;find_loc=Rainey+St%2C+Austin%2C+TX+78701&quot;&gt;Rainey Street Food Truck Lot&lt;/a&gt;. Then, off to what was listed on our agenda as “Secret Evening Plans”. All we knew about the secret up until that point was what was written on the schedule: “NOTE: Pack shorts &amp;amp; sandals that can get wet.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out, the secret surprise was an [on-brand] palindromic team kayak excursion to the Congress Avenue Bridge to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripsavvy.com/austins-bat-bridge-a-viewing-guide-254880&quot;&gt;Austin’s popular sunset bats&lt;/a&gt;! It was a huge hit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;blog-image-full-width&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Kayaking on the river/lake&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/ben-and-ro-kayak-austin.jpg&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Ben and Ro paddle away! Note the matching sweatshirts. The whole team was gifted new Savas swag!
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning some of us fit in some exercise :running_man:, and we all caught up on email and individual work before gathering for &lt;a href=&quot;https://torchystacos.com/menu/&quot;&gt;lunch&lt;/a&gt;. Afternoon team sessions were around the theme of “Looking Forward”—what’s in store for the future of Savas, trends in development from &lt;a href=&quot;/company/anne-tomasevich&quot;&gt;Anne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/company/dan-murphy&quot;&gt;Dan&lt;/a&gt;, and Oksana, and a look into what marketing plans we have in store for 2019 and beyond (spoiler: that involves &lt;a href=&quot;/company/jordan-nelson&quot;&gt;me&lt;/a&gt;!) . Ideas were pitched, concerns brought to light and addressed, and excitement built! There was an energy at this meeting. An energy of anticipation, excitement, and togetherness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;blog-image-full-width&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Outdoor meetings together at our airbnb&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/chris-dan-austin-run.jpg&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Chris and Dan go on a marathon training run in Austin together.
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We topped off ReTreat Yo Self 2019 with (probably too much) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bufalinapizza.com&quot;&gt;Bufalina Pizza&lt;/a&gt; (if there a such thing as too much pizza?) and fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;blog-image-full-width&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Departure power posing&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/power-pose-austin.jpg&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Do you think everyone is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_posing&quot;&gt;power posing&lt;/a&gt; on purpose?
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s to the future of Savas Labs! We are excited &lt;a href=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/careers/&quot;&gt;to be growing (come work with us!)&lt;/a&gt;, taking on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DukeGHI/status/1113538130706145280&quot;&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/results/&quot;&gt;impactful projects&lt;/a&gt;, and have the opportunity to work together each day. Until next time, Austin!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Savas Claus™: The inaugural holiday tradition</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;‘Tis the season of :gift: giving. Now that we’ve &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/12/11/savas-welcomes-ben-eckerson-coo.html&quot;&gt;brought Ben on&lt;/a&gt;, along with him has followed ample holiday cheer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;padding:76.12% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;m0&quot; src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/24452526?autoplay=1&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Ben was “Snowglobe Boy” for former employer ad agency &lt;a href=&quot;https://mckinney.com/&quot;&gt;Mckinney&lt;/a&gt; in December 2007 receiving over 100 million media impressions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben suggested — and we swiftly agreed to — our first annual Savas Claus™: the name we chose for our year-end holiday gift giving tradition. Oft referred to as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Santa&quot;&gt;Secret Santa&lt;/a&gt;, a group of people buys gifts for one another while keeping the giver and receivers anonymous until the big reveal. It’s a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, to randomly assign gift receivers to their respective givers, you write everyone’s name down on paper, put the names into a hat, and each person blindly picks a name for whom they get a gift. However, this analog approach has &lt;em&gt;one major flaw&lt;/em&gt;: one can easily end up with himself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;blog-image-large&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://media1.tenor.com/images/fe6a574d37f0b0189d412bb11e719906/tenor.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Kevin from the Office gets himself for Secret Santa&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-challenges&quot;&gt;The challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we knew we had ahead of us one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html&quot;&gt;the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; hard problems in computer science&lt;/a&gt;: cache-invalidation, off-by-one errors, and &lt;strong&gt;naming things&lt;/strong&gt;. Giving the naming task the gravity it deserved, we put it to a poll. Savas Claus™ prevailed by a narrow margin over Secret Savas (its main critique: being too close to “secret service”). Given the aforementioned self-selection consideration (“the Kevin problem”) and the fact that our team is distributed, we went for a digital solution. After all, we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; web engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-approach&quot;&gt;The approach&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Slack is so deeply ingrained in our day-to-day, we looked for a solution there first. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://savaslabs.slack.com/apps/A0E7EFUB1-secret-santa&quot;&gt;Secret Santa Slack app does exist&lt;/a&gt;, yet it didn’t afford us the flexibility and panache we were going for — plus it’s way more fun to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/savaslabs/savas-slack-tools/pull/5&quot;&gt;make your own&lt;/a&gt;! So we (well Chris) got in some weekend time to build a simple Slack app that would serve our needs during our weekly Monday morning team-wide status call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-it-works&quot;&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use tools on a near-daily basis that randomize the order of our team, for purposes like who gets to choose the lunch spot each week when we go out, or to randomize the order we speak during our weekly status call. So, adding the Savas Claus™ functionality was a natural extension to what we already had. The app creates a random order of the team (the “givers”), generates a second randomly ordered list of the team (“the receivers”) and pairs them with each other. If there are any repeats among the two lists in the same slot, the app automatically regenerates the second list and will repeat until the lists share no one in the same slot, and therefore receivers can safely be assigned to givers. With the lists vetted, the Slack app privately messages each giver notifying them of their respective recipient. The message looks &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/savas-claus-chris-screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chris's resulting Savas Claus private message&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NB: the exclamation point was meant to be a subtly hidden link, an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)&quot;&gt;:rabbit: :egg: easter egg&lt;/a&gt; if you will, but it seems Slack sensed it was the wrong time of year for such shenanigans and sabotaged the surprise unfurling the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6jCMaiTqG0&quot;&gt;office reference&lt;/a&gt; for all to see plainly. You win some and you lose some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-results-santa-christmas_tree-gift-gift_heart&quot;&gt;The results :santa: :christmas_tree: :gift: :gift_heart:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team is currently prepping and/or shipping their gifts before our “unwrapping” virtual party/social of sorts in a couple days. No doubt we’ll use our “Savas Shuffle” Slackbot to determine the order for who will open their gifts first. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/savaslabs&quot;&gt;Follow us on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and we’ll share the real results (the gifts!) from our first annual Savas Claus™.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcoming Ben Eckerson as COO of Savas Labs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For a little over a month now, &lt;a href=&quot;/company/ben-eckerson&quot;&gt;Ben Eckerson&lt;/a&gt; has been working hard to make an impact as Savas Labs’ new and first Chief Operating Officer. Ben joins us after six years at premier digital agency &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.viget.com/&quot;&gt;Viget&lt;/a&gt;, where he led business development and experimental IoT efforts for their Durham office (a couple blocks away from us in downtown Durham). Prior to Viget, Ben spent six years at creative New York/Durham agency &lt;a href=&quot;https://mckinney.com/&quot;&gt;Mckinney&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s Ben dressed up in his finest:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;blog-image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Ben rocking his Spiderman sweater in kindergarten&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/ben-as-a-child.png&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Ben dove right in sharing this kindergarten school photo with the team.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-ben-is-doing-at-savas-labs&quot;&gt;What Ben is doing at Savas Labs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With well over a decade in leadership roles in digital agencies, Ben will help to improve our operations to enhance the value we’re providing to our partners. He’ll also help get the exemplary work we do here at Savas out in the world better. Known for his knack for turning creative visions into reality, Ben will be the first person a new organization has a conversation with about how we can help them achieve their hopes and dreams or the first phone chat of a &lt;a href=&quot;/careers&quot;&gt;prospective job candidate&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond his official duties, Ben is a high-energy, team player who seeks to foster a fun and healthy culture with his new work family and we’re seeing that impact already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-that-have-changed-since-bens-start&quot;&gt;Things that have changed since Ben’s start&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’ve transitioned our internal team planning and scheduling efforts to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.getharvest.com/forecast&quot;&gt;Harvest’s forecast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’ve improved our retrospective process and documentation as well as our organization of project files in our Google Drive&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’ve had to up our Slack subscription to keep pace with Ben’s uncanny ability to find the perfect GIF (or create a new custom emoji) for any conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’ve implemented a &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/12/17/savas-claus.html&quot;&gt;Secret Santa&lt;/a&gt; tradition in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6jCMaiTqG0&quot;&gt;the office&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’ve instituted (and started planning) semi-annual retreats to bring together the full distributed team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;blog-image-large&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Map of country and team central meeting location&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/retreat-map.png&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;One of Ben's nominations for our retreat is Paris (Illinois).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;helping-to-make-savas-labs-more-social&quot;&gt;Helping to make Savas Labs more social&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben has &lt;em&gt;gently&lt;/em&gt; recommended that we more frequently share how special what we’ve created at Savas Labs is – hence my writing of this blog post &lt;del&gt;that he made me write&lt;/del&gt; about him. He also noted that the team has been so busy there was little time for engagement on social media. For fears he was beginning to detect some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bewKPi9gdT4&quot;&gt;early onset grumpiness&lt;/a&gt;, Ben has taken swift action to combat things before it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to transition your website from HTTP to HTTPS</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is part two of a two-part series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/06/26/why-you-need-https.html&quot;&gt;part one&lt;/a&gt;, we cogently convinced you that regardless of what your organization does and what functionality your website has, it is in your best interest to serve your website securely over HTTPS exclusively. Here we provide some guidance as to how to make the move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-transition-to-https&quot;&gt;How to transition to HTTPS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fully transition to HTTPS from HTTP means to serve your website HTML and assets exclusively over HTTPS. This requires a few basic things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A digital certificate from a certificate authority (CA)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proper installation of the certificate on your website’s server&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensuring all assets served from your website are served over HTTPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s break these down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;acquire-a-digital-certificate&quot;&gt;Acquire a digital certificate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As briefly discussed in &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/06/26/why-you-need-https.html&quot;&gt;part one&lt;/a&gt;, to implement HTTPS for your website you must procure a digital certificate from a certificate authority. Just like domain name registrars lease domain names, CAs lease digital certificates for a set time period. Each certificate has a public and private component. The public component is freely shared and allows browsers to recognize that a “trusted” CA was the one to distribute the certificate. It is also used to encrypt data transmitted from the browser. The private complement is only shared with the purchaser of the certificate, and can uniquely decrypt data encrypted by the public key. CAs use various methods through email or DNS to “prove” that the person who purchased the certificate is a rightful administrator of the domain for which they purchased it. Once you’ve received the private key associated with the certificate, you’ll need to install it on your server. Annual certificate costs can be as much as $1,000 or as little as nothing. More on that in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;install-the-certificate&quot;&gt;Install the certificate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/assets/img/blog/install-https-analogy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lots of wires&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installing an HTTPS certificate manually on a server is not a trivial engineering task. We &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/06/26/why-you-need-https.html#what-authentication-does-for-you&quot;&gt;explain this at a high-level in part one&lt;/a&gt;. It  requires expertise from someone who is experienced and comfortable administering servers. There are many different installation methods unique to each permutation of server software and hosting platform, so I won’t expend any real estate here attempting to lay it out. If you have to do a manual installation, it’s best to search your hosting provider’s documentation. However, depending on the complexity of your website architecture, there are ways to ease this process. Some hosting platforms have tools that substantially simplify the installation process. More on &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; in a moment as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;serve-all-resources-over-https-avoid-mixed-content&quot;&gt;Serve all resources over HTTPS: avoid mixed content&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve installed your certificate, it’s time to ensure all assets served from your pages are served over HTTPS. Naturally, this entire process should be completed in a staging environment before making the switch to your production environment. Completing a full transition to HTTPS requires attention to detail and diligence. “Mixed content”, or serving assets from a page over both HTTP &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; HTTPS, can be both tedious and insidious to rectify. The longer your site has been around, the more content there is and the more historic hands have been in the pot of content creation, the more work there will be to make the switch. Depending on your platform (CMS or otherwise) and how it was designed, there may be many avenues for different stakeholders to have included assets within a page over time. Developers, site admins, and content editors usually have the ability to add assets to a page. If any assets start with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://&lt;/code&gt;, they’ll need to be updated to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://&lt;/code&gt; to prevent mixed content warnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have recently helped a client who has been publishing articles at a high cadence for over 10 years with many different stakeholders over that period. Practices weren’t consistent and uncovering all the ways in which HTTP resources were served from the page was a substantial undertaking. Therefore, be prepared for a time investment here – there may be many areas to audit to ensure all assets from all your pages are being served over HTTPS. Some common ways mixed content HTTP assets are served from a site whose HTML is served over HTTPS are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hard-coding a resource: e.g. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://www.example.com/img/insecure-image.jpg&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using a 3rd-party library or ad network reference: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://www.example.com/js/analytics.js&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This is common for libraries that haven’t been updated in a while. Most all of them now serve the same assets over the same path securely with HTTPS.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.paulirish.com/2010/the-protocol-relative-url/&quot;&gt;practices that were previously encouraged by Paul Irish&lt;/a&gt;, a leading web architect for the Google Chrome team, may have contributed to your mixed content problem, so don’t feel bad. Just know, there will likely be work to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-risk-of-mixed-content&quot;&gt;The risk of mixed content&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These “not secure” bits of mixed-content &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/prevent-mixed-content/what-is-mixed-content#mixed_content_weakens_https&quot;&gt;expose the same risk&lt;/a&gt; that your HTML does when served over HTTP, so browsers rightfully show the user that the experience on your site is “not secure”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mixed content is categorized in two ways: active and passive. An asset that can contribute to passive mixed content would be an image; it doesn’t interact with the page but is merely presented on the page. An example that can be an active asset of mixed content is a javascript file or stylesheet since its purpose is to manipulate the page. Passive mixed content, albeit categorically less severe than active, still exposes opportunities for an attacker to learn a lot about an individual’s browsing patterns and even trick them into taking different actions than they intend to on the page. Therefore passive mixed content still constitutes enough of a threat for the browser to issue a warning display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/assets/img/blog/mixed-content-errors.png&quot; alt=&quot;mixed content browser errors&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of an active asset that is compromised, if it were a javascript file, an attacker can take full control of the page and any interaction you may have with it like entering passwords, or credit card information. The mechanism behind this is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/prevent-mixed-content/what-is-mixed-content#mixed_content_types_security_threats_associated&quot;&gt;somewhat sophisticated man-in-the-middle attack&lt;/a&gt;, but suffice it to say, if the browser recognizes the vulnerability, the best scenario is the &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/06/26/why-you-need-https.html#https-improves-credibility-and-ux&quot;&gt;poor user experience we discussed in part one&lt;/a&gt;, the worst is total data compromise. Your audience, and by association your organization, will be seeing red.
&lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/assets/img/blog/misconfigured-https.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chrome misconfigured HTTPS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-good-news-about-moving-to-https&quot;&gt;The good news about moving to HTTPS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensuring your website serves assets exclusively over HTTPS is not as hard as it used to be, and is getting easier by the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;there-are-free-digital-certificates&quot;&gt;There are free digital certificates&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no such thing as a free lunch, but a free certificate from a reputable CA? It would seem so. People are just giving them away these days… Seriously, many years in the making since its founding by two Mozilla employees in 2012, the Let’s Encrypt project has vowed to make the web a secure space and has successfully endeavored to become a trusted CA that literally does not charge for the certificates they provide. They have shorter lease cycles of 60 to 90 days, but they also offer tooling around automating the process of reinstalling newly provided certificates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;there-are-easier-and-cheaper-ways-to-install-certificates&quot;&gt;There are easier and cheaper ways to install certificates&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the advent of the aforementioned free certificate, many platform-as-a-service (PaaS) hosting options have incorporated low cost or free installation of certificates through their hosting platform sometimes as easily as a few clicks. Let’s Encrypt has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/web-hosting-who-support-lets-encrypt/6920&quot;&gt;adopted across a broad range of website hosting providers&lt;/a&gt; like Squarespace, GitHub Pages, Dreamhost, all of which we use alongside many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many of our Drupal partners, we prefer to use a platform as a service (PaaS) hosting option like Pantheon, Acquia, or Platform.sh. Both &lt;a href=&quot;https://pantheon.io/features/managed-https&quot;&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://platform.sh/blog/free-ssl-certificates-for-every-project-every-environment&quot;&gt;Platform.sh&lt;/a&gt; now provide a free HTTPS upgrade for all hosting plans; Acquia Cloud, another popular Drupal PaaS, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://redfinsolutions.com/blog/installing-free-lets-encrypt-ssl-certificates-acquia#comment-3290247800&quot;&gt;still a bit behind in this regard&lt;/a&gt;. We have found that the efficiency gains of spending less time in server administration translates to more value to our clients, empowering additional effort for the strategy, design, and development for which they hired us. In addition to efficiency, the reliability and consistency provided by finely tuned PaaS offerings are, in most cases, superior to manual installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good example of the evolution of hosting platforms maturing into the HTTPS everywhere world is our own Jekyll-based site, &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/tag/jekyll&quot;&gt;which we’ve written about&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fldrupal.camp/sessions/sessions-drupal-island/strange-case-dr-jekyll-and-mr-drupal&quot;&gt;presented on before&lt;/a&gt;. We first set up HTTPS over GitHub pages using CloudFlare guided by &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-and-fast-github-pages-with-cloudflare/&quot;&gt;this tutorial&lt;/a&gt; since we found it necessary to serve our site over HTTPS. However, about a year later &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.github.com/2018-05-01-github-pages-custom-domains-https/&quot;&gt;GitHub announced they would provide HTTPS support for GitHub pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Today, custom domains on GitHub Pages are gaining support for HTTPS via &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/letsencrypt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@letsencrypt&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s another step towards making the web more secure for everyone. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/MbB7Jjd3EE&quot;&gt;https://t.co/MbB7Jjd3EE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; GitHub (@github) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/github/status/991366832421523456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 1, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we had previously implemented &lt;a href=&quot;https://pantheon.io/blog/using-cloudflare-run-pantheon-sites-under-https-free&quot;&gt;Pantheon’s workaround&lt;/a&gt; to make HTTPS on all of their tiers accessible to our clients on their hosting platform. Then &lt;a href=&quot;https://pantheon.io/blog/pantheon-launches-global-cdn-automated-https-all-sites&quot;&gt;they announced HTTPS for all sites&lt;/a&gt;. We’re thankful both have gotten easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;there-are-tools-to-help-with-the-transition-to-https&quot;&gt;There are tools to help with the transition to HTTPS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through its powerful Lighthouse suite, Google has &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/mixed-content&quot;&gt;a tool to help audit and fix mixed content issues&lt;/a&gt;. Given the aforementioned tedium and potential difficulty of tracking down all the ways in which people have historically added content to your site, this can be an invaluable time saver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also use tools like Qualys SSL Labs to verify the quality of your HTTPS installation. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=savaslabs.com&amp;amp;latest&quot;&gt;how our site stacks up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wrap-up&quot;&gt;Wrap-up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the much greater ease at which many modern hosting platforms allow for HTTPS, the biggest barrier, primarily a matter of effort, is to clean up your content and make sure all assets are served over HTTPS from all pages within your website. So, if you haven’t already, start the transition now! &lt;a href=&quot;/contact&quot;&gt;Contact us&lt;/a&gt; over the phone or email if you need assistance and feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;#js-comments&quot;&gt;comment below&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
