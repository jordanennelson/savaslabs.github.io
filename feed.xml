        <title>Savas Claus™: The inaugural holiday tradition</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;‘Tis the season of :gift: giving. Now that we’ve &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/12/11/savas-welcomes-ben-eckerson-coo.html&quot;&gt;brought Ben on&lt;/a&gt;, along with him has followed ample holiday cheer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;padding:76.12% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;m0&quot; src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/24452526?autoplay=1&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Ben was “Snowglobe Boy” for former employer ad agency &lt;a href=&quot;https://mckinney.com/&quot;&gt;Mckinney&lt;/a&gt; in December 2007 receiving over 100 million media impressions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben suggested — and we swiftly agreed to — our first annual Savas Claus™: the name we chose for our year-end holiday gift giving tradition. Oft referred to as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Santa&quot;&gt;Secret Santa&lt;/a&gt;, a group of people buys gifts for one another while keeping the giver and receivers anonymous until the big reveal. It’s a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, to randomly assign gift receivers to their respective givers, you write everyone’s name down on paper, put the names into a hat, and each person blindly picks a name for whom they get a gift. However, this analog approach has &lt;em&gt;one major flaw&lt;/em&gt;: one can easily end up with himself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;blog-image-large&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://media1.tenor.com/images/fe6a574d37f0b0189d412bb11e719906/tenor.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Kevin from the Office gets himself for Secret Santa&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-challenges&quot;&gt;The challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we knew we had ahead of us one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html&quot;&gt;the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; hard problems in computer science&lt;/a&gt;: cache-invalidation, off-by-one errors, and &lt;strong&gt;naming things&lt;/strong&gt;. Giving the naming task the gravity it deserved, we put it to a poll. Savas Claus™ prevailed by a narrow margin over Secret Savas (its main critique: being too close to “secret service”). Given the aforementioned self-selection consideration (“the Kevin problem”) and the fact that our team is distributed, we went for a digital solution. After all, we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; web engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-approach&quot;&gt;The approach&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Slack is so deeply ingrained in our day-to-day, we looked for a solution there first. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://savaslabs.slack.com/apps/A0E7EFUB1-secret-santa&quot;&gt;Secret Santa Slack app does exist&lt;/a&gt;, yet it didn’t afford us the flexibility and panache we were going for — plus it’s way more fun to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/savaslabs/savas-slack-tools/pull/5&quot;&gt;make your own&lt;/a&gt;! So we (well Chris) got in some weekend time to build a simple Slack app that would serve our needs during our weekly Monday morning team-wide status call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-it-works&quot;&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use tools on a near-daily basis that randomize the order of our team, for purposes like who gets to choose the lunch spot each week when we go out, or to randomize the order we speak during our weekly status call. So, adding the Savas Claus™ functionality was a natural extension to what we already had. The app creates a random order of the team (the “givers”), generates a second randomly ordered list of the team (“the receivers”) and pairs them with each other. If there are any repeats among the two lists in the same slot, the app automatically regenerates the second list and will repeat until the lists share no one in the same slot, and therefore receivers can safely be assigned to givers. With the lists vetted, the Slack app privately messages each giver notifying them of their respective recipient. The message looks &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/savas-claus-chris-screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chris's resulting Savas Claus private message&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NB: the exclamation point was meant to be a subtly hidden link, an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)&quot;&gt;:rabbit: :egg: easter egg&lt;/a&gt; if you will, but it seems Slack sensed it was the wrong time of year for such shenanigans and sabotaged the surprise unfurling the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6jCMaiTqG0&quot;&gt;office reference&lt;/a&gt; for all to see plainly. You win some and you lose some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-results-santa-christmas_tree-gift-gift_heart&quot;&gt;The results :santa: :christmas_tree: :gift: :gift_heart:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team is currently prepping and/or shipping their gifts before our “unwrapping” virtual party/social of sorts in a couple days. No doubt we’ll use our “Savas Shuffle” Slackbot to determine the order for who will open their gifts first. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/savaslabs&quot;&gt;Follow us on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and we’ll share the real results (the gifts!) from our first annual Savas Claus™.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcoming Ben Eckerson as COO of Savas Labs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For a little over a month now, &lt;a href=&quot;/company/ben-eckerson&quot;&gt;Ben Eckerson&lt;/a&gt; has been working hard to make an impact as Savas Labs’ new and first Chief Operating Officer. Ben joins us after six years at premier digital agency &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.viget.com/&quot;&gt;Viget&lt;/a&gt;, where he led business development and experimental IoT efforts for their Durham office (a couple blocks away from us in downtown Durham). Prior to Viget, Ben spent six years at creative New York/Durham agency &lt;a href=&quot;https://mckinney.com/&quot;&gt;Mckinney&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s Ben dressed up in his finest:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;blog-image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Ben rocking his Spiderman sweater in kindergarten&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/ben-as-a-child.png&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Ben dove right in sharing this kindergarten school photo with the team.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-ben-is-doing-at-savas-labs&quot;&gt;What Ben is doing at Savas Labs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With well over a decade in leadership roles in digital agencies, Ben will help to improve our operations to enhance the value we’re providing to our partners. He’ll also help get the exemplary work we do here at Savas out in the world better. Known for his knack for turning creative visions into reality, Ben will be the first person a new organization has a conversation with about how we can help them achieve their hopes and dreams or the first phone chat of a &lt;a href=&quot;/careers&quot;&gt;prospective job candidate&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond his official duties, Ben is a high-energy, team player who seeks to foster a fun and healthy culture with his new work family and we’re seeing that impact already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-that-have-changed-since-bens-start&quot;&gt;Things that have changed since Ben’s start&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’ve transitioned our internal team planning and scheduling efforts to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.getharvest.com/forecast&quot;&gt;Harvest’s forecast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’ve improved our retrospective process and documentation as well as our organization of project files in our Google Drive&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’ve had to up our Slack subscription to keep pace with Ben’s uncanny ability to find the perfect GIF (or create a new custom emoji) for any conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’ve implemented a &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/12/17/savas-claus.html&quot;&gt;Secret Santa&lt;/a&gt; tradition in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6jCMaiTqG0&quot;&gt;the office&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’ve instituted (and started planning) semi-annual retreats to bring together the full distributed team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;blog-image-large&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;helping-to-make-savas-labs-more-social&quot;&gt;Helping to make Savas Labs more social&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben has &lt;em&gt;gently&lt;/em&gt; recommended that we more frequently share how special what we’ve created at Savas Labs is – hence my writing of this blog post &lt;del&gt;that he made me write&lt;/del&gt; about him. He also noted that the team has been so busy there was little time for engagement on social media. For fears he was beginning to detect some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bewKPi9gdT4&quot;&gt;early onset grumpiness&lt;/a&gt;, Ben has taken swift action to combat things before it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We are thrilled to announce (and welcome) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/beneckerson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@beneckerson&lt;/a&gt; as our new COO! Welcome to the Savas team, Ben! We&amp;#39;re so excited to have you!&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Savas Labs (@SavasLabs) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SavasLabs/status/1059906716224110597?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 6, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>How to transition your website from HTTP to HTTPS</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is part two of a two-part series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/06/26/why-you-need-https.html&quot;&gt;part one&lt;/a&gt;, we cogently convinced you that regardless of what your organization does and what functionality your website has, it is in your best interest to serve your website securely over HTTPS exclusively. Here we provide some guidance as to how to make the move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-transition-to-https&quot;&gt;How to transition to HTTPS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fully transition to HTTPS from HTTP means to serve your website HTML and assets exclusively over HTTPS. This requires a few basic things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A digital certificate from a certificate authority (CA)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proper installation of the certificate on your website’s server&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensuring all assets served from your website are served over HTTPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s break these down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;acquire-a-digital-certificate&quot;&gt;Acquire a digital certificate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As briefly discussed in &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/06/26/why-you-need-https.html&quot;&gt;part one&lt;/a&gt;, to implement HTTPS for your website you must procure a digital certificate from a certificate authority. Just like domain name registrars lease domain names, CAs lease digital certificates for a set time period. Each certificate has a public and private component. The public component is freely shared and allows browsers to recognize that a “trusted” CA was the one to distribute the certificate. It is also used to encrypt data transmitted from the browser. The private complement is only shared with the purchaser of the certificate, and can uniquely decrypt data encrypted by the public key. CAs use various methods through email or DNS to “prove” that the person who purchased the certificate is a rightful administrator of the domain for which they purchased it. Once you’ve received the private key associated with the certificate, you’ll need to install it on your server. Annual certificate costs can be as much as $1,000 or as little as nothing. More on that in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;install-the-certificate&quot;&gt;Install the certificate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/assets/img/blog/install-https-analogy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lots of wires&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installing an HTTPS certificate manually on a server is not a trivial engineering task. We &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/06/26/why-you-need-https.html#what-authentication-does-for-you&quot;&gt;explain this at a high-level in part one&lt;/a&gt;. It  requires expertise from someone who is experienced and comfortable administering servers. There are many different installation methods unique to each permutation of server software and hosting platform, so I won’t expend any real estate here attempting to lay it out. If you have to do a manual installation, it’s best to search your hosting provider’s documentation. However, depending on the complexity of your website architecture, there are ways to ease this process. Some hosting platforms have tools that substantially simplify the installation process. More on &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; in a moment as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;serve-all-resources-over-https-avoid-mixed-content&quot;&gt;Serve all resources over HTTPS: avoid mixed content&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve installed your certificate, it’s time to ensure all assets served from your pages are served over HTTPS. Naturally, this entire process should be completed in a staging environment before making the switch to your production environment. Completing a full transition to HTTPS requires attention to detail and diligence. “Mixed content”, or serving assets from a page over both HTTP &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; HTTPS, can be both tedious and insidious to rectify. The longer your site has been around, the more content there is and the more historic hands have been in the pot of content creation, the more work there will be to make the switch. Depending on your platform (CMS or otherwise) and how it was designed, there may be many avenues for different stakeholders to have included assets within a page over time. Developers, site admins, and content editors usually have the ability to add assets to a page. If any assets start with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://&lt;/code&gt;, they’ll need to be updated to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://&lt;/code&gt; to prevent mixed content warnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have recently helped a client who has been publishing articles at a high cadence for over 10 years with many different stakeholders over that period. Practices weren’t consistent and uncovering all the ways in which HTTP resources were served from the page was a substantial undertaking. Therefore, be prepared for a time investment here – there may be many areas to audit to ensure all assets from all your pages are being served over HTTPS. Some common ways mixed content HTTP assets are served from a site whose HTML is served over HTTPS are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hard-coding a resource: e.g. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://www.example.com/img/insecure-image.jpg&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using a 3rd-party library or ad network reference: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://www.example.com/js/analytics.js&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This is common for libraries that haven’t been updated in a while. Most all of them now serve the same assets over the same path securely with HTTPS.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.paulirish.com/2010/the-protocol-relative-url/&quot;&gt;practices that were previously encouraged by Paul Irish&lt;/a&gt;, a leading web architect for the Google Chrome team, may have contributed to your mixed content problem, so don’t feel bad. Just know, there will likely be work to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-risk-of-mixed-content&quot;&gt;The risk of mixed content&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These “not secure” bits of mixed-content &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/prevent-mixed-content/what-is-mixed-content#mixed_content_weakens_https&quot;&gt;expose the same risk&lt;/a&gt; that your HTML does when served over HTTP, so browsers rightfully show the user that the experience on your site is “not secure”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mixed content is categorized in two ways: active and passive. An asset that can contribute to passive mixed content would be an image; it doesn’t interact with the page but is merely presented on the page. An example that can be an active asset of mixed content is a javascript file or stylesheet since its purpose is to manipulate the page. Passive mixed content, albeit categorically less severe than active, still exposes opportunities for an attacker to learn a lot about an individual’s browsing patterns and even trick them into taking different actions than they intend to on the page. Therefore passive mixed content still constitutes enough of a threat for the browser to issue a warning display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/assets/img/blog/mixed-content-errors.png&quot; alt=&quot;mixed content browser errors&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of an active asset that is compromised, if it were a javascript file, an attacker can take full control of the page and any interaction you may have with it like entering passwords, or credit card information. The mechanism behind this is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/prevent-mixed-content/what-is-mixed-content#mixed_content_types_security_threats_associated&quot;&gt;somewhat sophisticated man-in-the-middle attack&lt;/a&gt;, but suffice it to say, if the browser recognizes the vulnerability, the best scenario is the &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/06/26/why-you-need-https.html#https-improves-credibility-and-ux&quot;&gt;poor user experience we discussed in part one&lt;/a&gt;, the worst is total data compromise. Your audience, and by association your organization, will be seeing red.
&lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/assets/img/blog/misconfigured-https.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chrome misconfigured HTTPS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-good-news-about-moving-to-https&quot;&gt;The good news about moving to HTTPS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensuring your website serves assets exclusively over HTTPS is not as hard as it used to be, and is getting easier by the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;there-are-free-digital-certificates&quot;&gt;There are free digital certificates&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no such thing as a free lunch, but a free certificate from a reputable CA? It would seem so. People are just giving them away these days… Seriously, many years in the making since its founding by two Mozilla employees in 2012, the Let’s Encrypt project has vowed to make the web a secure space and has successfully endeavored to become a trusted CA that literally does not charge for the certificates they provide. They have shorter lease cycles of 60 to 90 days, but they also offer tooling around automating the process of reinstalling newly provided certificates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;there-are-easier-and-cheaper-ways-to-install-certificates&quot;&gt;There are easier and cheaper ways to install certificates&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the advent of the aforementioned free certificate, many platform-as-a-service (PaaS) hosting options have incorporated low cost or free installation of certificates through their hosting platform sometimes as easily as a few clicks. Let’s Encrypt has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/web-hosting-who-support-lets-encrypt/6920&quot;&gt;adopted across a broad range of website hosting providers&lt;/a&gt; like Squarespace, GitHub Pages, Dreamhost, all of which we use alongside many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many of our Drupal partners, we prefer to use a platform as a service (PaaS) hosting option like Pantheon, Acquia, or Platform.sh. Both &lt;a href=&quot;https://pantheon.io/features/managed-https&quot;&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://platform.sh/blog/free-ssl-certificates-for-every-project-every-environment&quot;&gt;Platform.sh&lt;/a&gt; now provide a free HTTPS upgrade for all hosting plans; Acquia Cloud, another popular Drupal PaaS, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://redfinsolutions.com/blog/installing-free-lets-encrypt-ssl-certificates-acquia#comment-3290247800&quot;&gt;still a bit behind in this regard&lt;/a&gt;. We have found that the efficiency gains of spending less time in server administration translates to more value to our clients, empowering additional effort for the strategy, design, and development for which they hired us. In addition to efficiency, the reliability and consistency provided by finely tuned PaaS offerings are, in most cases, superior to manual installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good example of the evolution of hosting platforms maturing into the HTTPS everywhere world is our own Jekyll-based site, &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/tag/jekyll&quot;&gt;which we’ve written about&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fldrupal.camp/sessions/sessions-drupal-island/strange-case-dr-jekyll-and-mr-drupal&quot;&gt;presented on before&lt;/a&gt;. We first set up HTTPS over GitHub pages using CloudFlare guided by &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-and-fast-github-pages-with-cloudflare/&quot;&gt;this tutorial&lt;/a&gt; since we found it necessary to serve our site over HTTPS. However, about a year later &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.github.com/2018-05-01-github-pages-custom-domains-https/&quot;&gt;GitHub announced they would provide HTTPS support for GitHub pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Today, custom domains on GitHub Pages are gaining support for HTTPS via &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/letsencrypt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@letsencrypt&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s another step towards making the web more secure for everyone. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/MbB7Jjd3EE&quot;&gt;https://t.co/MbB7Jjd3EE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; GitHub (@github) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/github/status/991366832421523456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 1, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we had previously implemented &lt;a href=&quot;https://pantheon.io/blog/using-cloudflare-run-pantheon-sites-under-https-free&quot;&gt;Pantheon’s workaround&lt;/a&gt; to make HTTPS on all of their tiers accessible to our clients on their hosting platform. Then &lt;a href=&quot;https://pantheon.io/blog/pantheon-launches-global-cdn-automated-https-all-sites&quot;&gt;they announced HTTPS for all sites&lt;/a&gt;. We’re thankful both have gotten easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;there-are-tools-to-help-with-the-transition-to-https&quot;&gt;There are tools to help with the transition to HTTPS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through its powerful Lighthouse suite, Google has &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/mixed-content&quot;&gt;a tool to help audit and fix mixed content issues&lt;/a&gt;. Given the aforementioned tedium and potential difficulty of tracking down all the ways in which people have historically added content to your site, this can be an invaluable time saver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also use tools like Qualys SSL Labs to verify the quality of your HTTPS installation. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=savaslabs.com&amp;amp;latest&quot;&gt;how our site stacks up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wrap-up&quot;&gt;Wrap-up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the much greater ease at which many modern hosting platforms allow for HTTPS, the biggest barrier, primarily a matter of effort, is to clean up your content and make sure all assets are served over HTTPS from all pages within your website. So, if you haven’t already, start the transition now! &lt;a href=&quot;/contact&quot;&gt;Contact us&lt;/a&gt; over the phone or email if you need assistance and feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;#js-comments&quot;&gt;comment below&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why your website needs HTTPS</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is part one of a &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/08/01/how-to-move-to-https.html&quot;&gt;two-part series&lt;/a&gt; on transitioning to HTTPS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some time, major internet players have advocated for a ubiquitous, secure internet, touting the myriad benefits for all users and service providers of “HTTPS everywhere”. The most prominent and steadfast among them is Google. In the next week, continuing a multi-year effort to shepherd more traffic to the secure web, Google will make perhaps its boldest move to date which will negatively impact all organizations not securely serving their website over HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote the official &lt;a href=&quot;https://security.googleblog.com/2018/02/a-secure-web-is-here-to-stay.html&quot;&gt;Google Security Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Beginning in July 2018 with the release of Chrome 68, Chrome will mark all HTTP sites as “not secure”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/assets/img/blog/chrome-68-not-secure.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chrome insecure message for HTTP&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt; Google blog &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the ambiguous “in July 2018”, with no clearly communicated release date for Chrome 68, it’s wise to err on the side of caution and assume it will roll out on the 1st. We have readied our partners with this expectation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean for your organization if your site is not served over HTTPS? In short, it’s time to make the move. Let’s dig in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-https&quot;&gt;What is HTTPS?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTTP, or &lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt;yper&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;ext &lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;ransfer &lt;strong&gt;P&lt;/strong&gt;rotocol, is the internet technology used to communicate between your web browser and the servers that the websites you visit are on. HTTPS is the secure version (s for secure) which is served over TLS: Transport Layer Security. What these technical acronyms equate to are tools for internet communication that verify you’re communicating with who you think you are, in the way you intended to, in a format that only the intended recipient can understand. We’ll touch on the specifics in a moment and why they’re important. Put simply, HTTPS enables secure internet communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-secure-browsing-matters&quot;&gt;Why secure browsing matters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving aside the technical details for a moment and taking a broader view than communication protocols reveals more nuanced benefits your organization receives by communicating securely with its audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;https-improves-seo&quot;&gt;HTTPS improves SEO&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Google accounts for 75-90% of global search queries (&lt;a href=&quot;https://netmarketshare.com/search-engine-market-share.aspx?options=%7B%22filter%22%3A%7B%22%24and%22%3A%5B%7B%22deviceType%22%3A%7B%22%24in%22%3A%5B%22Desktop%2Flaptop%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D%2C%22dateLabel%22%3A%22Trend%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%22share%22%2C%22group%22%3A%22searchEngine%22%2C%22sort%22%3A%7B%22share%22%3A-1%7D%2C%22id%22%3A%22searchEnginesDesktop%22%2C%22dateInterval%22%3A%22Monthly%22%2C%22dateStart%22%3A%222017-06%22%2C%22dateEnd%22%3A%222018-05%22%2C%22segments%22%3A%22-1000%22%7D&quot;&gt;depending&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/267161/market-share-of-search-engines-in-the-united-states/&quot;&gt;on&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smartinsights.com/search-engine-marketing/search-engine-statistics/&quot;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;) SEO is understandably often synonymous with optimizing for Google. Given their market domination, competitors are taking queues from Google and in most cases it’s safe to assume what’s good for SEO in Google is good for optimizing competing search engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2014, &lt;a href=&quot;https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html&quot;&gt;Google announced on their blog&lt;/a&gt; that they would begin to favorably rank sites who used HTTPS over HTTP. It’s already been nearly four years since we’ve known HTTPS to be advantageous for SEO. Since then, Google has consistently advocated the concept of HTTPS ubiquity, frequently writing about it in blog posts and speaking about it at conferences. The extent to which serving your site over HTTPS improves your SEO is not cut and dry and can vary slightly depending on industry. However, the trend toward favoring HTTPS is well under way and the scales are tipped irreversibly at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;https-improves-credibility-and-ux&quot;&gt;HTTPS improves credibility and UX&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a user has arrived at your site, their perceptions may be largely shaped by whether the site is served over HTTP or HTTPS. The user experience when interacting with a site being served over HTTPS is demonstrably better. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.semrush.com/blog/https-just-a-google-ranking-signal/#header2&quot;&gt;SEMrush summarizes well&lt;/a&gt; what the data clearly indicate; people care a great deal about security on the web. A couple highlights:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/467656/us-online-shopping-concerns/&quot;&gt;second highest concern for online shoppers was security&lt;/a&gt;. The first was shipping being too expensive.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/339735/crime-worries-in-the-united-states/&quot;&gt;Crimes Americans worried about the most in 2016&lt;/a&gt;: #2 having credit card stolen (69%), and #3 having web identity compromised (64%).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You never get a second chance to make a first impression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With engaging a participant of your target audience, you have precious few moments to instill a sense of credibility with them. This is certainly true of the first time a user interacts with your site, but is also true for returning users. You have to earn your reputation every day, and it can be lost quickly. We know credibility decisions are &lt;a href=&quot;http://credibility.stanford.edu/guidelines/index.html&quot;&gt;highly influenced by design choices&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01449290500330448&quot;&gt;are made in well under one second&lt;/a&gt;. Combining these two insights, with the visual updates Chrome is making to highlight the security of a user’s connection to your site, drawing the user’s attention to a warning in the URL bar translates to a potentially costly loss in credibility. Unfortunately it’s the sort of thing that users won’t notice unless there’s a problem, and per the referenced cliché, at that point it may be too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;browsers-drawing-attention-to-insecure-http&quot;&gt;Browsers drawing attention to insecure HTTP&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like search, browser usage patterns have evolved over the last five years to heavily favor Google Chrome. Therefore, what Google does carries tremendous weight internet-wide. Current estimations of browser usage put Chrome between 55% and 60% of the market (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers&quot;&gt;again&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share&quot;&gt;depending&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx&quot;&gt;on&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3counter.com/trends&quot;&gt;sources&lt;/a&gt;). Firefox has followed suit with Chrome as far as HTTP security alerts go, and there’s no indication we should expect this to change. So it’s safe to assume a combined 60-75% of the market is represented by Chrome’s updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;google-chrome-http-warning-roll-out&quot;&gt;Google Chrome HTTP warning roll out&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google (and closely mirroring behind, Firefox) has been getting more stringent in their display of the security implications of a site served over HTTP (in addition to sites misconfigured over HTTPS). They’ve shared details on the six-step roll out on &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.chromium.org/2018/05/evolving-chromes-security-indicators.html&quot;&gt;their general blog&lt;/a&gt; as well as on a more technical, granular level on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/marking-http-as-non-secure&quot;&gt;Chrome browser blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2017, they began marking any site that collects a password field or credit card information, served over HTTP as subtly (grey text) not secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/assets/img/blog/jan-2017-http-not-secure.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chrome insecure message for HTTP&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Laravel News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, in October 2017, they tightened things up so that a site that collected &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; form information over HTTP, would have the same “not secure” messaging. They added the more action-based aspect of showing the warning on the URL bar &lt;em&gt;when a user entered data into a form&lt;/em&gt;. This is an especially obtrusive experience on mobile due to space constraints, which more deeply engages the user cognitively as to exactly what is unsafe about how they’re interacting with the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/assets/img/blog/oct-2017-http-insecure.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Chrome insecure message for HTTP&quot; class=&quot;blog-image-large&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt; Google blog &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, in July 2018, all HTTP sites will be marked as not secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2018, secure sites will be marked more neutrally, removing the green secure lock by default connoting a continuing expectation that HTTPS is the norm and no longer special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/assets/img/blog/sep-2018-neutral-https.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chrome insecure message for HTTP&quot; class=&quot;blog-image-large&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt; Google blog &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2018, any HTTP site that accepts any form fields will show affirmatively not secure with a &lt;span style=&quot;color:#cc0000&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bold red label&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, much like a misconfigured HTTPS site does now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/assets/img/blog/oct-2018-http-affirmative-insecure.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Chrome insecure message for HTTP&quot; class=&quot;blog-image-large&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt; Google blog &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though they haven’t yet announced a date, Google intends to show affirmatively not secure for all HTTP sites. The drive is clearly to establish the norm that all the web traffic should be served over HTTPS and that outdated HTTP is not to be trusted. This is a pretty strong message that if Google has their way (which they usually do) HTTPS will inevitably be virtually mandatory. And inevitably in internet years, may be right around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;https-vastly-improves-security-for-you-and-your-users&quot;&gt;HTTPS vastly improves security for you and your users&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to the technical, as mentioned previously, HTTPS helps secure communication in three basic ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authentication&lt;/strong&gt; “you’re communicating with who you think you are”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data integrity&lt;/strong&gt; “in the way you intended to”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encryption&lt;/strong&gt;: “in a format that only the intended recipient can understand”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-authentication-does-for-you&quot;&gt;What authentication does for you&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for the browser to recognize and evaluate an HTTPS certificate, it must be verified by a trusted certificate authority (CA). There are a limited amount of CAs who are entrusted to distribute HTTPS certificates. Through &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography&quot;&gt;public-key cryptography&lt;/a&gt;, a fairly complex but interesting topic, through inherent trust in the CA who has provided the HTTPS certificate for a given site, the browser can verify any site visitor is positively communicating with the expected entity with no way of anyone else posing as that entity. No such verification is possible over HTTP and it’s fairly simple to imagine what identify theft would be possible if you were communicating with a different website than you appeared to be. In the event any of the major browsers cannot validate the expected certificate, they will show a strong, usually red warning that you may not be communicating with the expected website, and strongly encourage you to reconsider interacting at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/assets/img/blog/misconfigured-https.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chrome misconfigured HTTPS&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the authentication gives your users the confidence you are who you say you are, which is important when you’re engaging with them in any way whether they’re providing an email, credit card or simply reading articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-data-integrity-helps-you&quot;&gt;How data integrity helps you&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensuring perfect preservation of communication over the internet is another guarantee HTTPS provides. When a user communicates with a website over HTTPS, the browser takes the input of that communication and using a one-way hashing function creates a unique “message digest”: a concise, alphanumeric string. The digest may only be reliably recreated by running the exact same input through the same hash algorithm irrespective of where and when this is done. For each request the user makes to the website, the browser passes a message digest alongside it and the server then runs the input it receives from the request through the hash algorithm to verify it matches the browser-sent digest. Since it is nearly computationally impossible to reverse engineer these hash functions, if the digests match, it proves the message was not altered in transit. Again, no such data integrity preservation is possible over HTTP, and there is therefore no way to tell if a message has been altered en route to the server from the browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-encryption-does-for-you&quot;&gt;What encryption does for you&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communicating over an unencrypted HTTP connection allows for some easily exploitable security risks in the case of authentication to a site. To demonstrate how easy it can be to take over someone’s account on an HTTP connection, a tool called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firesheep&quot;&gt;Firesheep&lt;/a&gt; was developed and openly released in mid 2010. Major social media platforms  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcworld.com/article/209333/how_to_hijack_facebook_using_firesheep.html&quot;&gt;Facebook and Twitter were both susceptible&lt;/a&gt; to this exploit for some time after Firesheep was released. The identity theft is carried out through a means called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_hijacking&quot;&gt;session hijacking&lt;/a&gt;. With Firesheep installed, a few clicks could log you in as another user who was browsing over WiFi nearby on any HTTP website. This form of session hijacking is possible when the authentication cookies, small identifying pieces of information that live in your browser while you’re logged into a site, are transmitted to the server  on each request over HTTP. Over WiFi these messages are broadcasted into the air in plain text, and can be picked up by anyone listening. HTTPS prevents this since the communication is encrypted and unintelligible to eavesdroppers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the example of a CMS like Drupal or any other system in which there is a login, if an administrator with elevated site permissions is logged in over HTTP, they’re subject to the same risk if that traffic is monitored or “sniffed” at any point along its path from the browser to the server. This is especially easy over WiFi but is not relegated to only WiFi. The cookies are sent to the server upon every request, regardless of whether or not the user entered their password during the active session or not. Depending on the admin’s privileges, this access can be easily escalated to complete control of the website. Encryption is a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;https-is-required-for-the-modern-web&quot;&gt;HTTPS is required for the modern web&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the more promising developments of the last few years, is the pervasiveness and effectiveness of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). PWAs is the name coined for a set of technologies that provide a feature-set for mobile browsing akin to native applications, yet is entirely served through the web browser. PWAs require all communication to be done over HTTPS. Some of the possibilities with PWAs that were previously relegated to native applications only are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Providing content and services based on the user’s location data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Providing interaction with the user’s camera and microphone within the browsing experience&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sending push notifications&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Serving off-line content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you aren’t taking advantage of any of these features that are possible through PWAs, it’s something your organization should strongly consider to further engage users. Before the ambitions to be on feature parity with native applications are fully borne-out, PWAs will continue to evolve the power of layering deeper engagement with users on top of your existing mobile experience with minimal effort. PWAs simply do not work over HTTP. HTTPS is required to open the door to their possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;barriers-to-https-have-been-lifted&quot;&gt;Barriers to HTTPS have been lifted&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, considering a move to HTTPS has been held back by some valid concerns for webmasters whose job it was to select where and how their websites were hosted. A few of the fundamental apprehensions could be categorized as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No perceived benefit.&lt;/strong&gt; People often assumed if they weren’t collecting financial or personal information, it wasn’t necessary. We’ve covered why holding this belief in 2018 is a misconception. Savas Labs made the move in July 2017 to serve exclusively over HTTPS for our &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/tag/jekyll/&quot;&gt;statically-generated Jekyll website&lt;/a&gt; even though at the time we had no forms or logins.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance costs.&lt;/strong&gt; We know reducing latency is crucial for optimizing conversions and HTTPS does require additional communication and computation. However, with the broad adoption of the HTTP/2 protocol over the last few years, HTTPS now &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.httpvshttps.com/&quot;&gt;usually outperforms HTTP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial costs.&lt;/strong&gt; HTTPS was too complex and costly to implement for some. Large strides have been made across many hosting providers who now bundle HTTPS into their hosting offerings by default, often at no additional cost. &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/&quot;&gt;Let’s Encrypt&lt;/a&gt;, a relatively new and novel certificate authority, first began offering free certificates (which they still do) and then made it easy to automatically renew those certificates, helping to ease the burden and cost of implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cover each of these in more detail in &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/08/01/how-to-move-to-https.html&quot;&gt;part two&lt;/a&gt; that will help guide you on how to make the move to HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To revisit Google’s announcement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Beginning in July 2018 with the release of Chrome 68, Chrome will mark all HTTP sites as “not secure”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interpreting that and providing our perspective:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You’re not part of the modern web unless you’re exclusively using HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bold, if slightly controversial statement, but for ambitious organizations like the folks we’re fortunate enough to work with each day, HTTPS-only is the standard in mid 2018 and beyond. Given the benefits, the lifted previous barriers, and the opportunity for the future, very few organization have a good reason not to exclusively serve their sites over HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Updating Drupal 8 core via Composer</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Updating Drupal 8 core with Composer has proven to be a problematic process for many developers. For some, this is nearly as upsetting as the fact that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/composer/getcomposer.org/issues/36&quot;&gt;the Composer logo is actually a conductor&lt;/a&gt;, and some have abandoned the platform entirely, opting to stick with Drupal 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process isn’t always as simple as running &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;composer update drupal/core&lt;/code&gt; and going about your day — the update from 8.3 to 8.4 was notoriously difficult and I recently experienced an issue while updating from 8.4.5 to 8.5.0. In this article, I’ve provided instructions for updating D8 core with Composer, plus some tips for dealing with common issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is especially important now as we await a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/psa-2018-001&quot;&gt;highly critical security update to all versions of Drupal&lt;/a&gt;, to be released on Wednesday, March 28, 2018. This level of security update is quite rare, but the update needs to be implemented on all sites as soon as possible after its release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the PSA linked to above notes, the Drupal Security Team will be providing security releases for unsupported minor versions 8.3.x and 8.4.x due to the issues many have encountered when updating from these versions. If you’re still on one of those versions, the update may be more straightforward if you stick with the release for that minor version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;general-instructions-for-updating-core&quot;&gt;General instructions for updating core&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let’s cover the steps needed to update Drupal 8 core with Composer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To update the core package, run:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; composer update drupal/core --with-dependencies -v
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It’s recommended to run the update command with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--with-dependencies&lt;/code&gt; flag to update any of Drupal core’s dependencies as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To capture any included database updates, run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;drush updb -y&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To capture any included configuration changes, run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;drush config-export -y&lt;/code&gt; and commit the changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three of these steps are necessary whenever the core package is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dealing-with-errors&quot;&gt;Dealing with errors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;core-version-doesnt-update&quot;&gt;Core version doesn’t update&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you run the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;composer update&lt;/code&gt; command but core isn’t updating, edit your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;composer.json&lt;/code&gt; file to include the specific version of core you want, e.g. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;^8.5&lt;/code&gt;. Then, run the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;composer update&lt;/code&gt; command again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;composer-command-outputs-errors&quot;&gt;Composer command outputs errors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Composer may not be able to resolve all of the dependencies of core and will output an error like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;set &lt;/span&gt;of packages.

    - Conclusion: don'&lt;/span&gt;t install drupal/core 8.5.0-alpha1
    - Conclusion: don&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'t install drupal/core 8.6.x-dev
    - Conclusion: remove symfony/config v3.2.9

    - Conclusion: don'&lt;/span&gt;t install symfony/config v3.2.9
    - drupal/core 8.5.x-dev requires symfony/dependency-injection ~3.4.0 -&amp;gt; satisfiable by symfony/dependency-injection[3.4.x-dev, v3.4.0, v3.4.0-BETA1, v3.4.0-BETA2, v3.4.0-BETA3, v3.4.0-BETA4, v3.4.0-RC1, v3.4.0-RC2, v3.4.1, v3.4.2, v3.4.3, v3.4.4, v3.4.5, v3.4.6].

    - symfony/dependency-injection v3.4.5 conflicts with symfony/config[v3.2.9].
    - symfony/dependency-injection v3.4.6 conflicts with symfony/config[v3.2.9].
    - Installation request &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for &lt;/span&gt;symfony/config &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;locked at v3.2.9&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; -&amp;gt; satisfiable by symfony/config[v3.2.9].
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This happens when one of Drupal’s dependencies is updated and the new version requires an updated version of another package. To resolve this, include the dependency package causing the issue in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;composer update&lt;/code&gt; command. The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--with-dependencies&lt;/code&gt; flag this will ensure that the dependency’s &lt;em&gt;dependencies&lt;/em&gt; are also updated. To fix the error above, I ran:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;composer update drupal/core symfony/config &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--with-dependencies&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-v&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;youre-not-alone&quot;&gt;You’re not alone&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you continue to run into problems, the best advice I can give you is to search for the specific update you’re trying to make. Every time I’ve had an issue I’ve been able to find discussions online regarding that specific update and potential resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, when I got the error above while trying to update to 8.5.0, I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://orkjern.com/updating-to-drupal-85-with-composer&quot;&gt;this helpful article&lt;/a&gt; by drupal.org user &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/u/eiriksm&quot;&gt;eiriksm&lt;/a&gt; and was able to resolve the issue.

        <title>The cost of investing in Drupal 7 - why it's time for Drupal 8</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is part two of a two-part series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/10/27/drupal-8-turns-2.html&quot;&gt;part one&lt;/a&gt;, we discussed how Drupal 8’s adoption in its first two years was a bit lackluster compared to what many expected. Grounded in a better understanding of the shortcomings of the past two years, we’ll try to equip those of you considering Drupal 8 with the information you need to make the best decision for your organization as you continue to invest in the powerful framework of Drupal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/assets/img/blog/drupal-early-adopter-vs-majority.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of Drupal 8 adoption curve&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt; Credit: Angie Byron AGAIN on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/AcquiaInc/acquia-d8-webinar/58&quot;&gt;“Everything you need to know about the top 8 changes in Drupal 8”&lt;/a&gt; from May 2015 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drupal 8 adoption is certainly no longer in the “early adopter” phase, yet we still haven’t entered the “majority” phase. For most organizations not yet powered by Drupal 8, our stance is: &lt;strong&gt;it’s probably time to upgrade&lt;/strong&gt;. The value you’re missing out on with the newer software &lt;em&gt;is real&lt;/em&gt;. Perhaps less obviously, if you’re investing in your Drupal 7 site beyond passive maintenance, you may well be doubling your long-term costs by deferring and exacerbating what will need to be refactored later. For organizations who have web staff, work with an agency, or do any non-trivial customization to their Drupal website, this applies to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-disclaimer-upfront&quot;&gt;A disclaimer upfront&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drupal agencies like ours benefit from upgrades in the short-term because they are usually a substantial undertaking. This fact, in part, is why over the past two years people have written more often about encouraging an upgrade to Drupal 8 rather offering a more holistic and measured perspective. A small dose of healthy skepticism typically serves site owners best. If Savas Labs is to live into its &lt;a href=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/company/mission-and-values/#be-respectful&quot;&gt;values&lt;/a&gt; we &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; factor in the needs of two other stakeholder groups when advising on an upgrade: our clients, and the collective Drupal community. Given the &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/10/27/drupal-8-turns-2.html#inertia-perceived-value-and-expense&quot;&gt;substantial effort to upgrade&lt;/a&gt;, if we focus solely on the short-term, we do our clients a disservice. In doing that, the next time those site owners and admins have the option to select a tool to power their web systems, they may look elsewhere remembering their pain and disappointment in recent experience. This ripple effect has the potential to create many former Drupal users. Imbued with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agrowingculture.org/open-source-ethos/&quot;&gt;open source ethos&lt;/a&gt;, we believe we owe it to the broader Drupal community from which we’ve gained so much to consult with honesty and integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-youre-missing-out-on&quot;&gt;What you’re missing out on&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/10/27/drupal-8-turns-2.html#complete-code-re-architecture&quot;&gt;we discussed in part 1&lt;/a&gt;, we lived through the challenges of the complete re-architecture of the Drupal application from 7 to 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angie Byron, the person I apparently can’t stop referencing, said in 2013:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For people who grew up learning PHP on Drupal, and there are a lot of people for whom that’s true, I think Drupal 8 will be kind of a big adjustment for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it wasn’t easy, at Savas Labs we feel strongly that it was a wise investment that’s just beginning to pay off. At this point in its maturation, we believe now (as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lullabot.com/articles/the-cultural-construction-of-drupal&quot;&gt;other Drupal leaders&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/dropping-forward&quot;&gt;felt for some time&lt;/a&gt;), that Drupal 8 is superior to previous versions in nearly all use cases for which organizations currently use Drupal. Some argue that Drupal 8 has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mydropwizard.com/blog/drupal-sucks-non-profits&quot;&gt;become too complex&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mydropwizard.com/blog/drupal-8-has-left-small-non-profits-behind-how-can-we-fix&quot;&gt;left smaller sites behind&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s important to consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mydropwizard.com/comment/410#comment-410&quot;&gt;their incentives&lt;/a&gt; for a well-rounded perspective. Via Acquia, Pantheon and other hosting providers, you can serve up a Drupal 8 website within minutes equipped with more features and a superior user experience to previous versions on a free tier to boot! While simultaneously catering better to those not writing code, the engineers who have always pushed Drupal to its physical limits have more power to build sophisticated tools and integrations that can do more for their clients than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In exploring this deeper, let’s start with the technical, and dig into the more nuanced to answer the Drupal 8 question: “What’s in it for me?” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/3001250/times-change-whats-it-me-question-you-need-answer&quot;&gt;WIIFM?&lt;/a&gt;), for &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wiifm-features&quot;&gt;WIIFM? Features.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s fairly easy to find information touting Drupal 8’s strengths around the web, and it’s pretty straightforward that software we write today (and have been writing for 4 years) is superior to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/drupal-7-code-freeze-september-1st&quot;&gt;software written 8.5 years ago&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/forum/deprecated/deprecated-drupal-newsletter/2007-06-06/the-drupal-newsletter-june-2007&quot;&gt;10.5 years ago with Drupal 6&lt;/a&gt;). Let’s look briefly at some high-impact improved features for site owners and admins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;designuxusability-improvements-with-drupal-8&quot;&gt;Design/UX/Usability Improvements with Drupal 8&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In developing Drupal 8, perhaps for the first time, the Drupal leadership &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/community-initiatives/drupal-core/usability&quot;&gt;took user experience work seriously&lt;/a&gt; and developed a cohesive &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupalsun.com/node/26589&quot;&gt;strategy to improve UX&lt;/a&gt; for Drupal 8. The results paid off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/mobile/responsive-web-design&quot;&gt;Responsive out of the box&lt;/a&gt;: Given that Drupal 8’s release came long after responsive web design became popular enough to garner its own acronym, naturally, all themes (administrative and otherwise) were developed to be responsive. RWD has been a must for years, but it took heavy lifting to achieve in Drupal 7.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2017/03/06/five-drupal-8-tips-to-empower-content-authors.html&quot;&gt;Better content authoring&lt;/a&gt;: Drupal 8 has adopted a more Wordpress-like UX for editors, which for many years had been cited as a distinction between the two, rightfully favoring Wordpress. Content authoring layout improvements coupled with responsiveness have made administration from a phone a pleasant experience.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/8/usability&quot;&gt;Accessibility at lower cost&lt;/a&gt;: Accessibility efforts, though not prioritized by all, continue to gain traction as we continue to expand our ability to &lt;a href=&quot;/company/mission-and-values/#be-inclusive&quot;&gt;be inclusive&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve seen clients threatened with lawsuits over not adhering to accessibility standards. Whether motivated by benevolence or risk-aversion, accessibility should be on your radar, and it’s easier in Drupal 8.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/8/multilingual&quot;&gt;Multilingual in core&lt;/a&gt;: With a cohesive system now in core, we have been able to build a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.durhamatletico.com/&quot;&gt;couple of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://howsyourbabync.org/&quot;&gt;multilingual sites&lt;/a&gt; with relative ease, not having to dedicate substantial additional time to the translation component.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Drupal 8 multilingual is a world of difference. What would take 22 or more modules in Drupal 7 you would do with 4 (and all in core). &lt;span&gt;- @kristen_pol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;restful-possibilities&quot;&gt;RESTful possibilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the developmental focuses of Drupal 8 we believe has tremendous impact on how organizations can maximize the value of their content is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/node/2757967&quot;&gt;API-first Initiative&lt;/a&gt;. We will likely write an entire post about this in the future, but in short the initiative makes Drupal 8 much better equipped to serve as a central content repository that can expose content to many types of devices in the formats they require for display. Historically, Drupal has been pretty exclusively focused on producing HTML (one format) for a web browser (the device/software). Drupal 8 now treats Roku, iOS &amp;amp; Android Apps, video game systems and the web browser all as first-rate citizens for content consumption. As the number and variety of devices that connect to the web &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/471264/iot-number-of-connected-devices-worldwide/&quot;&gt;continues to rapidly grow&lt;/a&gt;, Drupal 8 can serve as a powerful hub that provides relevant content and experiences to end-users. You’d be remiss to snooze on this one. To get an idea of the possibilities check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.contentacms.org/&quot;&gt;Contenta CMS&lt;/a&gt;, a Drupal 8 distribution built by some of the people behind the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wiifm-performance&quot;&gt;WIIFM? Performance.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you take performance seriously, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/&quot;&gt;which you should&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a lot to like about Drupal 8. Sticking with the theme of sophistication, Drupal 8 provides a much more granular ability to cache specific components than its predecessors. And as we know in the high-performance web world, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/http-caching&quot;&gt;cache&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.catchpoint.com/2017/03/13/caching-web-performance/&quot;&gt;is&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/web-caching-basics-terminology-http-headers-and-caching-strategies&quot;&gt;king&lt;/a&gt;. When Drupal 8 first came out, a leading Acquia engineer showed some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2016/yes-drupal-8-slower-drupal-7-heres-why&quot;&gt;mixed results&lt;/a&gt; on Drupal 8 performance. The heavier codebase invariably means having to swim upstream to make it outperform the lighter codebase in Drupal 7, but I’m happy to say the architects had their flippers on when working through these challenges. Take these two fundamental points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Regardless of how fast the underlying code executes, what matters to users is perceived performance, i.e. how long they have to wait to interact with the page. Perceived delay has been drastically reduced by an experimental-turned-core module (more on that later) called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/bigpipe/overview&quot;&gt;BigPipe&lt;/a&gt;. BigPipe loads components of a page in the order in which a user is expected to interact with them while delivering more expensive components as they’re available. This breaks with the tradition of all-or-nothing webpages served by Drupal that were either in the cache or not, lending itself to a Facebook-like experience, which is where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/bigpipe-pipelining-web-pages-for-high-performance/389414033919/&quot;&gt;BigPipe came from&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/assets/img/blog/bigpipe-in-drupal-8.gif&quot; alt=&quot;GIF of Drupal 8 BigPipe Video&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=41&amp;amp;v=JwzX0Qv6u3A&quot;&gt;Slower video here&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Modern performance tactics derive the largest gains from &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; of the application leveraging services like a Content Delivery Network (CDN), and/or a web application accelerator, &lt;a href=&quot;https://varnish-cache.org/intro/index.html#intro&quot;&gt;like Varnish&lt;/a&gt;, to serve up resources to anonymous traffic (users &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; signed-in) as quickly as possible. For most sites, anonymous traffic comprises a majority of overall traffic. Traditionally, there have been limitations to improving performance for authenticated traffic, and that’s where Drupal 8 shines. With BigPipe and a more granular caching system, Drupal 8 can substantially outperform Drupal 7’s authenticated user experience, so it’s a win-win.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re made of time today, check out our &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/tag/performance&quot;&gt;other articles we’ve written about performance&lt;/a&gt; for a deeper dive into this broad and complex topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wiifm-people&quot;&gt;WIIFM? People.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that behind any powerful movement are powerful people. To quote Dries, as I did in my Drupalcon talk in New Orleans:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;fostering the Drupal community is actually more important than just managing the code base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, atop the Drupal.org homepage &lt;a href=&quot;https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/sessions/stay-community&quot;&gt;used to read&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Come for the code, stay for the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without needing to resonate with all the warm and fuzzies that many within the community do, these sentiments show the richness and value of the Drupal community. And that rich community, not out of neglect, but rather necessity, has moved on from Drupal 7. Top designers, developers, and strategists are working on few Drupal 7 projects these days, and most would prefer to move on. For those who work with web designers and engineers (or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/u/chrisarusso&quot;&gt;used to be one like me&lt;/a&gt;), you know that they often have an insatiable appetite for learning, and want to do that with increasingly relevant tools to their growth and output. Sticking to dated software is an effective way to weed out the best and brightest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-improved-developer-experience-dx-of-drupal-8&quot;&gt;The Improved Developer Experience (DX) of Drupal 8&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like happy customers tend to be repeat customers, &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2015/10/29/happy-productivity-work/&quot;&gt;happier developers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/3048751/happy-employees-are-12-more-productive-at-work&quot;&gt;also produce returns&lt;/a&gt;; they’re &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.snacknation.com/blog/employee-happiness/&quot;&gt;more productive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few improvements in Drupal 8 that make life &lt;em&gt;substantially&lt;/em&gt; better for developers. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/configuration-management/managing-your-sites-configuration&quot;&gt;Configuration Management Initiative&lt;/a&gt; was a boon to developers who struggled with a module called “features” which was not designed to do what most of us used it for. The CMI addresses the previous workaround, rife with inconsistencies, of moving site configuration from development to staging and production environments. Although it may seem trivial, developers &lt;em&gt;love this better system&lt;/em&gt; in Drupal 8, and it means more efficient development, therefore higher ROI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;proudly-found-elsewhere--not-invented-here--getting-off-the-island&quot;&gt;Proudly found elsewhere / not invented here / getting off the island&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A primary Drupal 8 philosophy that has largely been successful, but yet to fully bear fruit, is the concept to drastically reduce “Drupalisms” that had proven a challenge for newcomers to the system who had to learn a suite of things specific to only Drupal. The proudly found elsewhere paradigm seeks to mitigate this by leveraging the best of other open source tools when possible rather than reinvent the wheel. A few of the tools Drupal 8 now exploits are &lt;a href=&quot;https://symfony.com/&quot;&gt;Symfony components&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twig.symfony.com/&quot;&gt;Twig templating engine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://getcomposer.org/&quot;&gt;Composer Dependency Manager&lt;/a&gt;. This “borrowing” has two positive consequences: 1) it reduces the workload for Drupal core contributors by utilizing what’s freely available and well vetted through other communities, 2) it allows people familiar with those other frameworks a smoother onramp to productivity in Drupal. I believe we haven’t yet seen a majority of the benefit to the Drupal 8 project from the many people who were already versed in Symfony and TWIG before working with Drupal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote Angie Byron for the thousandth time (&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/wWnhfTSkmoU?t=386&quot;&gt;full video here&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For people who are classically trained or have experience in other languages, Drupal 8 is going to make a lot more sense to them than Drupal 7 did. We’re just falling more in line with what the larger people are doing… within the broader PHP community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wiifm-cost-savings&quot;&gt;WIIFM? Cost savings.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The active decision to upgrade or passive indecision to wait both have cost implications. Perhaps this is the most useful section for readers whose primary responsibilities aren’t technical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing to invest in Drupal 7 (or earlier) can be costly in ways that may not be abundantly apparent on the surface. For most organizations who work with an agency, custom development is where a brunt of the efforts are spent, and therefore is the primary cost driver. “Custom development” occurs when the functionality a client requests is either not freely available on the open-source market or the agency is unaware of its existence and a developer will write code for the specific use case to “extend” the out-of-the-box functionality. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle&quot;&gt;80-20 rule&lt;/a&gt; applies well to software development in Drupal: roughly 20% of the functionality a client requests accounts for 80% of the effort of a project since that 20% must be built from scratch. When site owners request various functionality, it can be difficult for them to differentiate what may constitute custom development efforts vs. freely available from the contributed community. Given the high effort of customization and related technical debt accumulated, site owners should request a high degree of transparency to understand what requires custom development when establishing project budgets. This way, the organization can do a cost/benefit analysis on a granular, per-feature basis. The goal for developers should be to always start with exploring what already-made wheels are out there for the turning before crafting their own. Be wary of alternative thinking. Yet, as extensible and rich the Drupal community is, nearly all of our engagements require customization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;easy-drupal-upgrades-forever&quot;&gt;Easy Drupal upgrades forever&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/assets/img/blog/the-promise-of-making-drupal-upgrades-easy-742x1114.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A happy Drupal sunrise&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt; Image from Dries’s blog post &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the surprise of the community, in an abrupt departure from business-as-usual in early 2017, Dries committed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/making-drupal-upgrades-easy-forever&quot;&gt;“easy upgrades forever”&lt;/a&gt;, starting with Drupal 8 of course. The short of it is Drupal 8 to 9 upgrades should be &lt;strong&gt;far easier&lt;/strong&gt; (and less expensive) than any previous major version upgrade, and so will be from here on in. That means for those not yet on Drupal 8, you only have one final difficult upgrade left in your Drupal journey until the end of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a fairly natural outcome given the possibilities afforded by a more structured, object-oriented architecture coupled with the growing desire to ease upgrade pain that has been building for some time. Although difficult technical work is needed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/core/d8-bc-policy&quot;&gt;flesh out exactly how this will be done&lt;/a&gt;, the commitment from the top is worth putting stock in and the community is on the way to making this grand proclamation a reality. When upgrades are far easier, they will help rectify some of the sentiment of leaving the smaller sites behind, since major version upgrades will be a much less daunting task with Drupal 8 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;drupal-6-or-7-custom-development-is-especially-expensive&quot;&gt;Drupal 6 or 7 custom development is especially expensive&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, perhaps the &lt;strong&gt;most important point&lt;/strong&gt; is that you may be doubling your efforts for the final time if you’re doing custom development on Drupal 6 or 7, since it will invariably need to be rewritten to work on Drupal 8 with the same 80-20 rate we mentioned earlier. Given the commitment to easy upgrades and guidelines for backwards compatibility, it’s quite likely that custom code written for Drupal 8 will be highly portable to Drupal 9 and 10 that won’t require an arduous rewrite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/assets/img/blog/house-for-drupal-6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Drupal 6 house&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt; Not our actual house, and it’s not &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; bad.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in the equivalent of a Drupal 6 house. My partner and I keep putting off things we’d like to do now in prep for a more substantial renovation “on the horizon.” We’re not going to get solar panels before replacing the roof, and we won’t upgrade to a high energy efficiency HVAC system until we restructure some of the foundation. We’re being mindful of mitigating our overall costs, which makes sense, but this all sets up a perverse incentive to make no improvements in the immediate. The same can be true for an older Drupal site. As she frequently reminds me, I’ll remind you: it’s probably time to take the plunge and build your Drupal 8 house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;cost-to-upgrade-is-going-down&quot;&gt;Cost to upgrade is going down&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there remains one final decidedly not easy upgrade if you’re not yet on Drupal 8, the good news is the cost to upgrade has gone down and will continue to. As of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/blog/drupal-8-4-0&quot;&gt;release of 8.4.0&lt;/a&gt;, migrating from Drupal 6 is nearly all the way there:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Core provides migrations for most Drupal 6 data and can be used for migrating Drupal 6 sites to Drupal 8, and the Drupal 6 to 8 migration path is nearing beta stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sentiment on 7, expectedly so, is not as far along:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 migration is incomplete but is suitable for developers who would like to help improve the migration and can be used to test upgrades especially for simple Drupal 7 sites. Most high-priority migrations are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So migration from 7 still requires some work. More on this ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;early-adopters-paved-the-way&quot;&gt;Early adopters paved the way&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all owe a debt of gratitude to those who were willing to take the risk of building on Drupal 8 in its earlier days. We commend both organizations and agencies who were ambitious and willing to incur some risk to help push the rest of the project forward. We’re proud to put ourselves on that list, starting &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/savaslabs/durham-civil-rights-map/commit/7736d4f7375845db5adfd38df721d091a2c72db3&quot;&gt;2.5 years ago&lt;/a&gt;, but it unsurprisingly came with challenges and lessons learned. Mistakes that come with experience are virtually entirely positive for the future since we’ve learned what to do and what to avoid. It’s time for you to benefit from the work of the early adopters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wiifm-the-future&quot;&gt;WIIFM? The Future.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future is uncertain; the only things guaranteed are death and taxes. Actually, even &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/news/2017-03-economists-minimum-income.html&quot;&gt;those&lt;/a&gt; I’m &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/aging-is-reversible-at-least-in-human-cells-and-live-mice/&quot;&gt;not so sure&lt;/a&gt; :wink: Regardless, the future for Drupal 6 and 7 are a known entity not likely to get much better. The upside of Drupal 8, while partially known, is largely still in the making and will keep getting better over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;continuous-innovation-with-experimental-modules-who-doesnt-want-that&quot;&gt;Continuous innovation with experimental modules! Who doesn’t want &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the suite of other firsts, Drupal 8 has &lt;a href=&quot;#continuous-innovation-with-experimental-modules-who-doesnt-want-that&quot;&gt;updated its minor version approach&lt;/a&gt; to accommodate for innovations in core and this is another game changer. Previously, the first version of Drupal 7 (7.0) was essentially functionally the same as the latest (currently 7.56). Now new minor releases introduce &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental&quot;&gt;experimental modules&lt;/a&gt; which are driven by agreed-upon priorities and are then vetted over time to see if they’ll graduate from the “experimental” label and be fully baked into core. Therefore Drupal 8 can and will adapt; Drupal 7 cannot. The transparent structure leadership established provides a good balance of innovation and predictability with two minor version releases a year. To track these for your own planning, at any time you can check the development &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/core/roadmap&quot;&gt;roadmap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;Javascript&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Drupal community has been abuzz with “headless” or “decoupled” Drupal since the advent of Drupal 8. The basic idea is that Drupal can lean on its strength of being an excellent tool for highly structured and organized data in the backend while allowing freedom and flexibility of choice on the presentation layer (front end). Though &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/should-we-decouple-drupal-with-a-client-side-framework&quot;&gt;discussed two years ago&lt;/a&gt; to no formal conclusion, Dries has recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/drupal-looking-to-adopt-react&quot;&gt;cited React&lt;/a&gt; as the go-to presentation layer for Drupal administrative interfaces come early 2018. This is a fairly big deal, and formally moving forward to more tightly link with React has many implications we haven’t yet fully explored. As the lines between websites and web applications continue to blur, this proudly-found-elsewhere addition may prove to be a powerful one that will not be possible for Drupal 6 or 7. We see this as another wise move to be more in-sync with the rapidly growing impact of JS frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;access-to-complementary-tools&quot;&gt;Access to complementary tools&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The re-architecture towards object-orientation helped Drupal join the modern PHP community’s framework (&lt;a href=&quot;https://symfony.com/&quot;&gt;Symfony&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://laravel.com/&quot;&gt;Laravel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cakephp.org/&quot;&gt;Cake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://phalconphp.com/en/&quot;&gt;Phalcon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://framework.zend.com/&quot;&gt;Zend&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slimframework.com/&quot;&gt;Slim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codeigniter.com/&quot;&gt;CodeIgniter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yiiframework.com/&quot;&gt;Yii&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://fuelphp.com/&quot;&gt;Fuel&lt;/a&gt; to name the most popular) development practices. One subtle yet substantial value to that move is now many tools that are built to help support these other frameworks are available to Drupal as well. As the toolkit for modern web development grows richer and more robust, the more Drupal can utilize, the better. A couple examples we’ve recently used to help inform project quality and future maintenance costs are &lt;a href=&quot;https://codeclimate.com/&quot;&gt;Code Climate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://scrutinizer-ci.com/&quot;&gt;Scrutinizer&lt;/a&gt;. These tools have much less value analyzing a Drupal 6 or 7 site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-advice&quot;&gt;Our advice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’ve dumped a lot of information on you at this point, but it may still not be entirely clear what you should do with your outdated Drupal site. Ahead we provide general suggestions as well as what is pertinent to site owners for each version separately (Drupal 6 and 7).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-everyone-on-drupal-8&quot;&gt;To everyone on Drupal &amp;lt;8&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still have &amp;lt;3 for Drupal &amp;lt;8. Drupal 5, 6, and 7 got us to where we are. But here’s what we think you should consider about where you’re going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan 3 years out&lt;/strong&gt; if possible. A stitch in time saves nine, and every minute of planning saves 10 in execution. They’re clichés, but true. Planning well requires a real dedication to strategic and investigative work; there’s no way around it. The upside is it allows you to be intentional about when to incorporate an upgrade, rather than being at the mercy of expiring security support. Organizational stakeholders are usually not compelled by upgrading for the sake of upgrading without other bells and whistles that come with it. An experienced partner can help shepherd the long-term planning process to provide guidance on efforts and things to consider. If you’re not working with an agency, do it yourself. Expect to redesign and do a software upgrade every 3-5 years and time those together if possible. Factor in upgrades to other systems that integrate with your website as well as any initiatives that may require functional improvements. Put all of these larger investments on a &lt;strong&gt;roadmap&lt;/strong&gt; with a timeline and be clear about what components are dependent on or impacted by other components. With technical work, the devil is in the details, so a thorough assessment or “discovery project” is usually the best next step. Discovery work is light on upfront investment yet thorough enough to guide your organization through the many choices in your roadmap. This is really the best way to use your resources most efficiently. If your organization hasn’t historically done this, it handicaps you a bit at the moment, but if you’ll excuse one final cliché: there’s no time like the present.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be mindful of what you &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; need&lt;/strong&gt;. We all get excited about the possibilities of new functionality. However, when things we’ve built have outlived their purpose, let them go. Given the complexity and interdependence of the tools we build, customizations take the form of mounting, insidious and potentially crippling technical debt if left unaddressed. The cost to upgrade the technical debt is likely the major cause for most of those who have not yet upgraded; it is certainly the case for all of our partners who haven’t. This debt can be hard to track, and it’s not something most agencies proactively share since they have a hand in creating it and can also be shortsighted. Ask for answers as to how your partner is managing your technical debt. If you don’t get good answers, keep asking. Another subset of this concept is that even if you want to maintain certain functionality, it needn’t be done in the with the same modules on the Drupal 8 platform. So don’t take a given module’s absence in Drupal 8 as a certainty that it cannot be efficiently achieved in Drupal 8. In many cases, it can.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training will be required.&lt;/strong&gt; If you plan to build with the same team that built your &amp;lt;8 site, and they have not worked on any other Drupal 8 or object-oriented PHP projects, make sure you dedicate time and budget resources for substantial training.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-those-with-production-drupal-6-sites&quot;&gt;To those with production Drupal 6 sites.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a Drupal 6 series as Drupal 8 had announced its release (the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/24/drupal-6-upgrade.html&quot;&gt;overview&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/10/drupal-6-part-2.html&quot;&gt;the risks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/25/drupal-6-part-3.html&quot;&gt;the options&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/02/24/drupal-6-part-4.html&quot;&gt;Drupal 7 or 8&lt;/a&gt;) which is a good reference for both what was true then and what has changed now. Then, I certainly encouraged a conversation with your partner about what is right for you. That has not changed. What has changed is the maturity of the migration system, making it easier to port your content from 6 to 8. An upgrade to Drupal 8 by way of migration should be where you start based on all of the above, and the job before committing to that path is to well vet all requirements to migrate. Given that migrations are high-effort, you should explore alternatives with your development team. How much it’s worth to invest in a migration depends on how valuable your old content is to preserve, which varies widely among organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If through research you uncover that you’re still not ready for Drupal 8, you should make an action plan to follow up on the components that will allow you to upgrade to Drupal 8 and track those over time. You should look into efforts to upgrade to Drupal 7, being mindful of how you can mitigate the costs to the Drupal 8 upgrade. You should consider support with the MyDropWizard team in the immediate. It’s lead by David Snopek who is on the core security team and has an impressive Drupal resume. It’s hard to assess how the support provided by MDW compares to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://security.drupal.org/team-members&quot;&gt;core security team&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s much better than not having any security support. I would also caution those to not use the relief from having coverage through MDW as a reason to rest on your laurels. If Drupal is still working for you, you should be thinking about how to get to Drupal 8. Additionally, as we agreed earlier there’s no longer even certainty to death and taxes, it’s possible that things could change for MDW, and you’d be without support again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-those-with-production-drupal-7-sites&quot;&gt;To those with production Drupal 7 sites.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as building new on Drupal 7, I have a hard time conceptualizing for whom that is the right choice. MDW &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mydropwizard.com/blog/its-ok-build-new-sites-drupal-7&quot;&gt;wants to keep the door open to building new in Drupal 7&lt;/a&gt;, but others &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mydropwizard.com/comment/916#comment-916&quot;&gt;point out incentives again&lt;/a&gt;. Much like the hat tip to Dries for accepting criticism, I must commend MDW accepting these comments on their blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a high degree of customization and technical debt, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/node/2608062&quot;&gt;keep track of the development of Drupal 9&lt;/a&gt;. Upgrade now cannot be prescriptive for the 900,000+ sites still on Drupal 7. We generally agree with Angie’s recent presentation at Acquia Engage called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/webchickenator/drupal-9-and-backwards-compatibility-why-now-is-the-time-to-upgrade-to-drupal-8/39&quot;&gt;Drupal 9 and Backwards Compatibility: Why now is the time to upgrade to Drupal 8&lt;/a&gt; for those on Drupal 7:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If it’s working for you that’s fine! (Until Drupal 9)
But if D8 offers features you want, consider earlier adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you’ve determined that you’ll remain on Drupal 7 for some time, your development team should be aware of a couple Drupal modules (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/xautoload&quot;&gt;xautoload&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/service_container&quot;&gt;service_container&lt;/a&gt;) that make writing Drupal-8 like code possible in Drupal 7. These tools will help familiarize developers with Drupal 8 paradigms and possibly reduce substantial technical debt in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-those-not-on-drupal-but-considering-it&quot;&gt;To those not on Drupal, but considering it&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re in the market for a CMS and have ambitious web goals, you should at least check out Drupal. It’s been holding &lt;a href=&quot;https://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/content_management&quot;&gt;fairly steadily in the CMS market&lt;/a&gt;, and given some of the problems of the past with versions before Drupal 8, we think this speaks very promisingly of the future for Drupal. This is not to say that it is the right fit for all websites. It is not. However, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://pantheon.io/features/drupal-hosting&quot;&gt;free hosting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.acquia.com/acquia-cloud-free&quot;&gt;options&lt;/a&gt;, an improved and simplified admin experience, and the most powerful backend of the open source CMSes, it does fit a lot of needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-want-to-hear-from-you&quot;&gt;We want to hear from you&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to hear from your experience, whether or not it resonates with what we’ve presented here. Are you having challenges to upgrading that you feel went unaddressed here?

        <title>Drupal 8 turns 2. Are you taking advantage of it yet?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Drupal 8’s official release was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/blog/drupal-800-released&quot;&gt;nearly two years ago&lt;/a&gt;, and many ask how is it doing? Has it lived up to its ambition to revolutionize Drupal websites?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first of a &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/11/08/cost-of-drupal-7.html&quot;&gt;two-part series&lt;/a&gt;, we’ll provide our insight into the evolution of Drupal 8 over its first two years in the wild. In &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/11/08/cost-of-drupal-7.html&quot;&gt;part two&lt;/a&gt;, we’ll look at important factors to consider in your Drupal investments going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;drupal-change-is-hard&quot;&gt;(Drupal) Change is hard&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To launch a website (much like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-O5IHVhWj0&quot;&gt;to rock a rhyme that’s right on time&lt;/a&gt;) is tricky; to operate a web system in a way that uplifts your organization is &lt;em&gt;just plain hard&lt;/em&gt;. Although keeping up with the most current software is typically advisable, there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; costs to doing so, even for free software like Drupal. Without the vendor lock-in that comes with proprietary Content Management Systems, Drupal site owners have a high degree of freedom to consider how best to invest their web resources. However, this freedom also has a price (see a pattern emerging?) in the form of &lt;strong&gt;time&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;stress&lt;/strong&gt; incurred from the responsibility to select the best digital tools to drive your organization for years with &lt;em&gt;limited&lt;/em&gt; information to evaluate the nearly &lt;em&gt;limitless&lt;/em&gt; options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/usage/drupal&quot;&gt;1 million+&lt;/a&gt; organizations whose main window to the digital world is powered by Drupal, many have priorities that compete in time and budget with web system investments. When considering these priorities, determining the right time to invest in an improved user experience, design, feature-set, or software upgrade can be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the ever-increasing complexity and interconnectedness of the software systems we build, even the world’s most prominent organizations, often with legions of engineers, have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/6-software-updates-that-went-wrong-2015-12/#a-small-update-to-the-iphones-software-last-year-caused-thousands-of-phones-to-lose-their-cellular-connections-1&quot;&gt;had&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/19/technology/personaltech/why-windows-10-upgrades-go-wrong-and-how-to-avoid-it.html&quot;&gt;colossal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2016/03/07/how-recover-iphone-update-gone-bad/81427214/&quot;&gt;mishaps&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/08/500-smart-locks-arent-so-smart-anymore-thanks-to-botched-update/&quot;&gt;upgrades&lt;/a&gt;. By default, upgrades are not easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To upgrade or not? &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; is the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any decision, whether you’re building new or upgrading, the fundamental question is: do the benefits outweigh the costs? In the specific case of investing in Drupal the question becomes: &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; does making the leap to Drupal 8 rather than continuing to invest in Drupal 7 (or possibly 6… don’t tell me it’s 5 :wink: ) outweigh the costs to take that leap? For any organization to properly answer that question, it’s necessary to look 3-5 years out with regard to budget and organizational goals. It’s also helpful to better understand how the broader community has approached this same decision over the past two years. Let’s take a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/assets/img/blog/stock.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;stock market image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After nearly two years since its public release, how has the adoption of Drupal 8 gone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;analysis-from-the-top&quot;&gt;Analysis from the top&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before DrupalCon North America in May 2016 in New Orleans, Drupal founder and current project lead Dries Buytaert &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/how-is-drupal-8-doing&quot;&gt;blogged that Drupal 8 was doing “outstanding,”&lt;/a&gt; citing statistics to substantiate his optimistic view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Based on my past experience, I am confident that Drupal 8 will be adopted at “full-force” by the end of 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many in the community contested the veracity of his optimism in the article’s comments and I &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/how-is-drupal-8-doing#comment-125541&quot;&gt;commended Dries&lt;/a&gt; (yes that’s me and not &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MadDogUnleashed&quot;&gt;him&lt;/a&gt;, and definitely not &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tvguide.com/news/apprentice-trump-russo-39885/&quot;&gt;him&lt;/a&gt;) for facilitating an open conversation that elicited a broad perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a month later, some six months after Drupal 8 was released, Savas Labs attended DrupalCon NOLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We have arrived &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/DrupalCon?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#DrupalCon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/NOLA?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#NOLA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DrupalConNA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@DrupalConNA&lt;/a&gt;!!!! &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/yesfilter?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#yesfilter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/RlkNAu99nB&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/RlkNAu99nB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Savas Labs (@SavasLabs) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SavasLabs/status/729504649233899521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 9, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Ksp5JVFryEg?t=464&quot;&gt;perennial “Driesnote,”&lt;/a&gt; Dries continued to present Drupal 8 as well on its way to match if not exceed the success of Drupal 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I really truly believe, Drupal 8 will take off. My guess is that by the end of this year [2016] Drupal 8 will serve an escape velocity… it will become the de facto standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The new architecture, features, as well as frequent releases: all of these things make me feel really, really optimistic and bullish about Drupal 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;adoption-by-the-numbers&quot;&gt;Adoption by the numbers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/usage/drupal&quot;&gt;usage statistics&lt;/a&gt; available on the Drupal website, when writing this nearly 80% of the world’s Drupal websites were powered by version 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/assets/img/blog/drupal-version-graph.png&quot; alt=&quot;drupal stats d8&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt; A graph started by &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ETrxAEHgLepeCR8WhuMDrWba1IKXJGd32Lq0hh5szjs/edit#gid=93393428&quot;&gt;Angie Byron of Acquia&lt;/a&gt; that I updated to present. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Drupal 7 was released on January 5, 2011, there were already more Drupal 7 sites than sites powered by the major version two releases prior: Drupal 5 (A). The same feat for Drupal 8 took over nine months after its release to achieve (C). Total Drupal 7 sites eclipsed total sites of its predecessor version (6) about 13 months after the release of Drupal 7 (B). After nearly 2 years from the release of Drupal 8, it has not yet eclipsed Drupal 7 installations, and at present there are over 700,000 &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; Drupal 7 sites than Drupal 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;our-take-on-driess-bullish-ness&quot;&gt;Our take on Dries’s bullish-ness&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To his credit, the future is notoriously difficult to predict, and even when predicting it, Dries spoke of the significant work that lay ahead to see his vision come to fruition. He also made the referenced comments well over a year ago, and I’ll concede speaking in hindsight is infinitely easier. Having said that, comparing the total number of upgraded Drupal 8 sites to Drupal 7 sites over the same period from release in a community that had grown ~220% since Drupal 7’s release, while factually indisputable, was probably not as accurate as using adoption percentages to analyze overall trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the most conservative interpretations of “escape velocity” or “full-force” would have to concede that we’re at least a year behind Dries’s hopes when he was reporting from DrupalCons Barcelona and New Orleans on impending rapid Drupal 8 adoption. But, what’s a dictator worth his salt to do, &lt;a href=&quot;https://randyfay.com/content/how-do-open-source-communities-govern-themselves&quot;&gt;benevolent&lt;/a&gt; or not, other than to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-jarvis/8-out-of-10-statistics-ar_b_6516014.html&quot;&gt;stretch the stats&lt;/a&gt; a bit to show what he would like to be true for his beloved community, from which he also profits?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;our-assessment&quot;&gt;Our assessment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After two years, the data unequivocally show, as I began discussing &lt;a href=&quot;https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/sessions/total-value-ownership-drupal-8-and-beyond&quot;&gt;at DrupalCon New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;, the rate of Drupal 8 adoption is objectively slower than Drupal 7. At this point, a majority of organizations have not yet upgraded from 7 to 8, though likely many have begun efforts. Taking a simplistic view, this means Drupal 8 has either been more costly to upgrade, a comparatively less valuable product, or perhaps both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, since it matters to our partners, we found it important to explore the reasons behind the slow adoption rather than to pretend it’s not happening. After architecting Drupal 8 web systems for 2.5 years, we have gained insight into the relatively slow adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;drupal-8-adoption-challenges&quot;&gt;Drupal 8 adoption challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drupalers haven’t written much about the retrospective analysis of the Drupal 8 adoption challenges. But without being able to take a real, honest look inward, we cannot improve. We must know thyself because the examined Drupal problems are worth fixing! We highlight here the most prominent challenges that have slowed Drupal 8 adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-complete-code-re-architecture&quot;&gt;1. Complete code re-architecture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/why-the-big-architectural-changes-in-drupal-8&quot;&gt;massive shift of the underpinnings of the Drupal code&lt;/a&gt; is a decision that has long been debated within the community. There’s no question it has proven a challenge for proficient Drupal 7 developers to develop on Drupal 8: for most, substantial training and learning is required. Training takes time, and time can often mean money. The loss in short-term efficiency for seasoned Drupal developers made early adoption riskier, and typically added to a project’s expense. Joining with other prominent frameworks known outside of Drupal like Twig and Symfony (colloquially referred to as “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/off-the-island-2013&quot;&gt;getting off the island&lt;/a&gt;”) was a collective decision by wise Drupal leadership with the long-term value of the product in mind, but in the short-term, for the average Drupal developer, it meant more new things to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-slow-contributed-module-porting&quot;&gt;2. Slow contributed module porting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically Drupal has derived much of its usefulness from the rich contributed module ecosystem that extends the features of Drupal core. Contributed modules, although crucial to most live Drupal websites, by definition are not directly driven by those that oversee Drupal core development. This disconnect invariably leads to some important modules not having a usable upgraded version when a new major version of Drupal core is released. This is well-known within the Drupal community, &lt;a href=&quot;http://webchick.net/node/129&quot;&gt;explained at great length by Angie Byron&lt;/a&gt; (second reference), and not unique to the Drupal 8 release. Tremendous amounts of individual and community efforts are required to upgrade modules to the latest major version. Due to &lt;a href=&quot;#complete-code-re-architecture&quot;&gt;#1 from above&lt;/a&gt;, these efforts were further exacerbated by the re-architecture. Costs to upgrade even one module (it’s common for a Drupal 7 site to use 100) are often greater than clients or agencies are willing to absorb on a given project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-incomplete-upgrade-path&quot;&gt;3. Incomplete upgrade path&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often describe websites as comprised of three main asset groups: the &lt;strong&gt;code&lt;/strong&gt; (Drupal core, contributed and custom modules), &lt;strong&gt;files&lt;/strong&gt; (think media assets like images), and the &lt;strong&gt;database&lt;/strong&gt; where content and site configuration lives. When upgrading, you download the new Drupal code, which has a set of instructions that must be run to apply complex updates to the database. Files remain unchanged. A well-oiled upgrade process is required to update the content and configuration from the site being upgraded into a format intelligible to the new system. The approach to perform those upgrades &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/upgrade/upgrading-from-drupal-6-or-7-to-drupal-8&quot;&gt;has also changed in Drupal 8&lt;/a&gt; to what is now referred to as “a migration”. As of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/blog/drupal-8-4-0&quot;&gt;most recent minor release of Drupal 8&lt;/a&gt; in October states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…Drupal 6 to 8 migration path is nearing beta stability. Some gaps remain, such as for some internationalization data. The Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 migration is incomplete but is suitable for developers who would like to help improve the migration and can be used to test upgrades especially for simple Drupal 7 sites. Most high-priority migrations are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Nearing beta stability” after two years out from release is not ideal though it is reality since perfecting these migration tasks is hard work. One can discern from the Drupal 7 -&amp;gt; 8 migration snippet that it’s clearly further afield, and for those who need to preserve their content, perhaps a non-starter for a 7 -&amp;gt; 8 upgrade. The inability to efficiently update database structures adds to project expense. Whatever doesn’t come over “for free” with the migration will need to be manually replicated by a human, and humans are costly, as our time is precious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-stance-on-backwards-compatibility&quot;&gt;4. Stance on backwards compatibility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drupal’s approach to backwards compatibility is famously “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/node/2613652&quot;&gt;for data, not code&lt;/a&gt;”. Briefly put, in their words: “While the upgrade path will reliably preserve your data, there is no backward compatibility with the previous Drupal code.” If you want to dig deeper, there’s a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/backward-compatibility&quot;&gt;good&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/core/d8-bc-policy&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/blog/the-transformation-of-drupal-8-for-continuous-innovation&quot;&gt;on&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/core/d8-allowed-changes#bc-break&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://events.drupal.org/baltimore2017/sessions/backwards-compatibility-burden-benefit&quot;&gt;topic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/about/release-cycle/version-numbering/&quot;&gt;WordPress’s approach&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps more than anything, explains &lt;a href=&quot;https://trends.builtwith.com/cms&quot;&gt;its ubiquity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/about/stats/&quot;&gt;ability to better keep sites on the latest version&lt;/a&gt;. In their words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Major releases add new user features and developer APIs. Though typically a “major” version means you can break backwards compatibility (and indeed, it normally means that you have), WordPress strives to &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; break backwards compatibility. It’s one of our most important philosophies, and makes updates much easier on users and developers alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Albeit a bit confusing, even for the non-technologist, you get the sense they’re more worried about breaking stuff and want upgrades to Just Work™. The strength of the Drupal approach is it allows for more innovation, and in some ways, less baggage since preserving backwards compatibility often means hanging on to outdated code. The trade-off is, once old code is determined to be holding innovation back, it’s cast to the side, and new structures must be implemented in the updated version. Historically, this paradigm has caused many to get stuck in an outdated Drupal version for longer than they’d like because they cannot afford an upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-inertia-perceived-value-and-expense&quot;&gt;5. Inertia, perceived value, and expense&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A modern organization is focused on more than &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; their website, and for investments that don’t deliver direct, visual, tangible change, stakeholders often overlook them, even when they may present value. Examples where the value is oft-invisible to clients are investing in an automated testing framework that ensures perpetual site integrity, or vigilantly applying security updates as they become available. In either case, the client may perceive them as optional, but foregoing them is likely to cost the organization in the long-run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Drupal only provides security support for two major versions at a time (presently 7 and 8), for many, the prime motive for a new release, often framed as a mandate, is to upgrade from the version two major releases prior, which has fallen out of support. When Drupal 8 came out, Drupal 6 fell out of support after a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/forum/general/news-and-announcements/2014-06-18/drupal-6-extended-support-announcement&quot;&gt;grace period of three months&lt;/a&gt;, generously extended from the day of release given some of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/node/2136029&quot;&gt;community’s recognition&lt;/a&gt; of some of the challenges we’ve documented here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an organization doesn’t heed the security warnings, and doesn’t find enough value in the new features, they may choose to ignore the upgrade completely. The truth is it’s hard to estimate the future risk of using outdated software. However that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csoonline.com/article/2130877/data-breach/the-16-biggest-data-breaches-of-the-21st-century.html&quot;&gt;future risk is very real&lt;/a&gt;, and digital security compromises show no signs of slowing down. Savas Labs always advocates for timely security coverage, but it has not always been a budgetary possibility for our partners to upgrade from Drupal 6 to Drupal 8 upon release of 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-answer-to-the-drupal-6-problem&quot;&gt;An answer to the Drupal 6 problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to our experience, the usage data show many organizations did not plan sufficiently to upgrade from Drupal 6 to 7 or 8 upon Drupal 8’s release. Recognizing that, a Drupal agency My Drop Wizard set up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mydropwizard.com/drupal-6-lts&quot;&gt;long-term security support&lt;/a&gt; for the many Drupal 6 sites that were not ready to upgrade to Drupal 8. It’s debatable whether or not this was a good thing for the community. People forced to change, often will change sooner than they would otherwise, but they may resent you for it. Conversely, you’d be hard-pressed to find an MDW client who didn’t experience anxiety relief when offered an inertia-compliant alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizations that don’t perceive opportunity in the value the new software provides will look at an upgrade strictly as an expense to avoid, likely citing topics we’ve covered here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;takeaways&quot;&gt;Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through experience and analysis, we see there are many understandable and justifiable reasons why many organizations haven’t yet upgraded to Drupal 8. Now that we’ve done the hard reflection, the good news is that the present is a much brighter place for not only Drupal 8 but all future versions of Drupal. We have made it through most of the difficult growing pains, and there’s great reason to believe that the community has invested wisely in the future. In &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/11/08/cost-of-drupal-7.html&quot;&gt;part two&lt;/a&gt;, we cover the costs of investing in Drupal 7, and why it’s probably time to move to Drupal 8.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Savaslabs.com Redesign</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At Savas Labs, we are a forward-looking bunch, much like our neighbors around the corner from our Durham office, The Republik, who wear that badge a little more… overtly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/the-republik-building.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Front of The Republik building&quot; class=&quot;blog-image-full-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though future-focused-first, we &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; recognize the importance of history and the value of a little reflection. After all, we  &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; learn from our mistakes to truly thrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Know from whence you came. If you know whence you came, there are absolutely no limitations to where you can go. - James Baldwin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside: I can’t recommend the award-winning documentary about James Baldwin’s legacy &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iamnotyournegrofilm.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am not your negro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; strongly enough. See it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;from-whence-we-came&quot;&gt;From whence we came…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Savas Labs matured substantially in 2016, refining processes and adding new team members who brought complementary skills. It’s both intriguing and humbling to reflect on just how much we learned in the past year. It wasn’t all &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?biw=1524&amp;amp;bih=979&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=1&amp;amp;q=puppy+dogs+and+ice+cream&amp;amp;oq=puppy+dogs+and+ice+cream&quot;&gt;puppy dogs and ice cream&lt;/a&gt;, but the successes and the challenges helped us carve out our place in the world. We worked with consultants, analyzed and soul-searched to elicit what it is we love doing &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; are really good at as a growing team. One manifestation of these pursuits was the establishment of &lt;a href=&quot;/company/mission-and-values/&quot;&gt;our core values&lt;/a&gt;. They help hold us and future Savasians (coining the demonym &lt;em&gt;Savasian&lt;/em&gt; - another thing we did in 2016) accountable to an agreed upon set of principles which drive how we treat one another and our partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to internal analysis, we studied our best projects to see what characteristics in partners and their challenges for which we are best fit. We uncovered that what we enjoy most and truly &lt;a href=&quot;/company/mission-and-values/#excel&quot;&gt;excel&lt;/a&gt; at are projects with strategic and complex needs that lean heavily on our deep Drupal expertise usually requiring inter-departmental engagement within organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ergo: our positioning statement that appears front-and-center on our &lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;homepage&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We craft elegant Drupal web systems that propel organizations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-the-redesign&quot;&gt;Why the redesign&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, the typical reason, because we wanted to :wink:. In truth, we were due for a redesign as the last time we did this was &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/04/01/building-our-site.html&quot;&gt;over two years ago&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, given our growth, we felt our website did not reflect the quality of work we’ve been doing. As we updated our message, we recognized copy updates alone would be insufficient to demonstrate our capabilities. In the process, we took advantage of the artistic skillset of one of our 2016 additions to the team, &lt;a href=&quot;/company/oksana-cyrwus/&quot;&gt;Oksana Cyrwus&lt;/a&gt;, to create a vision of our team’s identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;construction-materials&quot;&gt;Construction Materials&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we’re usually building client websites in Drupal, we chose to continue with the static site generator Jekyll which we’ve &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/tag/jekyll/&quot;&gt;written about before&lt;/a&gt; as our platform. We believe firmly in using the right tool for the job and use a multitude of technologies, frameworks and programming languages in any given &lt;del&gt;Sunday&lt;/del&gt; workday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/codeguy&quot;&gt;Josh Lockhart&lt;/a&gt; a local author and creator of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slimframework.com/&quot;&gt;Slim PHP MicroFramework&lt;/a&gt; advised a developer audience at a recent PHP conference talk (&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/hH4HyfXiH9Y?t=924&quot;&gt;Video link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Be aware that other tools exist and that they may be better suited for certain tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, for us, the benefits outweighed the drawbacks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/inertia.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;man pushing a rock: inertia&quot; class=&quot;blog-image-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bennies&quot;&gt;Bennies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No database back-end, meaning reduced security threats and reduced hosting complexity. We’re able to host for free on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/10/19/optimizing-jekyll-with-gulp.html&quot;&gt;highly-performant framework&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2016/10/25/deploy-jekyll-with-travis.html&quot;&gt;Ease of deployment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Efficient for our workflow as it is developer oriented.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inertia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;drawbacks&quot;&gt;Drawbacks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Requires Ruby ecosystem competency which often presents the need to acquire new skills for Drupalers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Requires developer-level skills to update.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Not as robust of an ecosystem as Drupal for example.
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Example: When we were dissatisfied with our comment options, we &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/04/20/squabble-comments.html&quot;&gt;built our own server&lt;/a&gt; on guess what, a different framework. This took us time and is less feature-rich than what we’d get with Drupal out of the box.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These drawbacks, though not without their costs, are also opportunities for us to be a part of the broader web ecosystem and learn. The more exposure to best-practices and other frameworks, the more we can borrow from and employ them in our work, though it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an investment to develop the expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll works for us since the &lt;a href=&quot;/company#team&quot;&gt;team of savvy Savasians&lt;/a&gt; is comfortable rapidly learning a new workflow to publish updates to our website. Additionally our website needs are relatively simple, certainly compared to the needs of many of our partners. Our partners often have personnel with a wide range of technical training and often require sophisticated content models, granular authentication and permissions, advanced content publishing workflows among many other common needs for which a modular ecosystem of plugins like Drupal’s would be better suited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside Jekyll, we used &lt;a href=&quot;http://trulia.github.io/hologram/&quot;&gt;Hologram&lt;/a&gt; developed by Trulia for our &lt;a href=&quot;/styleguide&quot;&gt;style guide&lt;/a&gt;. It proved to be a great workflow for our designer, front-end developer and myself to interact efficiently and see updated results in the browser rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;timing&quot;&gt;Timing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And today… Today we celebrate our independ… no - we celebrate our redesigned website launch and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://events.drupal.org/baltimore2017&quot;&gt;Drupalcon Baltimore&lt;/a&gt; kickoff simultaneously! Coincidence? Of course not! However, I would like to give a shoutout to my entire team for making this happen on a tight schedule and an extra big-ups to Anne and Oksana who put in extra hours in the weeks leading up to make today possible. It was fun to be a part of the building process again; I found myself feverishly reloading the site every time new code was pushed up, which was often many, many times a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now it’s time to show off our fancy new website complete with business cards to boot! Tell us what you think &lt;a href=&quot;#js-comments&quot;&gt;in comments&lt;/a&gt; or on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=We%20think%20the%20redesign%20is%20likely,%20nay,%20probable,%20to%20bring%20about%20world%20peace%20%F0%9F%8C%8F%20%E2%98%AE%EF%B8%8F%20Congrats%20%40savaslabs%21&amp;amp;source=webclient&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Got the new fully recyclable ♻️  green business cards in honor of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/EarthDay2017?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#EarthDay2017&lt;/a&gt; 🌏 📅  just in time for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Drupalcon?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Drupalcon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/YMg90yU1UT&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/YMg90yU1UT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Savas Labs (@SavasLabs) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SavasLabs/status/854730073152385027?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 19, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Lightning Talks - Three Useful Additions to Any Developer Toolbox in Q1 2017</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is part of a new series called “Lightning Talks.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web development world evolves quickly, and keeping abreast of new tools and methodologies while simultaneously delivering client work is tough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our core &lt;a href=&quot;/company/mission-and-values/#excel&quot;&gt;philosophies&lt;/a&gt; at Savas Labs is to “&lt;em&gt;hold ourselves to a high and constantly improving standard&lt;/em&gt;.” To that end, we dedicate time each month to share new tips and tools with each other to continue increasing our collective knowledge base – we call these our :zap: “Lightning Skillshares!” :zap:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we believe in the open source ethos and sharing with the community, in this series, we’ll highlight some tips we use to improve our day-to-day efficiency (and hopefully yours too!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we’ve added to our toolboxes in Q1 2017:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#using-teleconsole-for-collaboration&quot;&gt;1. Using Teleconsole for collaboration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#accessing-a-dockerized-database-via-phpmyadmin-or-phpstorm&quot;&gt;2. Accessing a Dockerized database via PhpStorm or PhpMyAdmin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#using-apowersofts-free-screen-recorder-to-capture-your-screen&quot;&gt;3. Using Apowersoft’s Free Online Screen Recorder to capture your screen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-using-teleconsole-for-collaboration&quot;&gt;1. Using Teleconsole for collaboration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teleconsole.com/&quot;&gt;Teleconsole&lt;/a&gt; lets you share your UNIX terminal session for easy collaboration! We’ve been using it for a couple months now and find it to be an excellent addition to our team toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works by starting an SSH server on the host computer and generating a unique session ID that others can connect to via their terminal or a web browser. You can have multiple connected individuals in a session, though we typically use it more for 1-1 debugging and troubleshooting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be aware, collaborators will have &lt;em&gt;direct&lt;/em&gt; access to your terminal, so only share with people you trust and be careful about accidental commands. Other than that, it’s free and easy to set up – check it out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teleconsole.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/lightning-17q1-teleconsole-demo.gif&quot; class=&quot;blog-image-full-width&quot; alt=&quot;Teleconsole demo&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Terminal sharing 2,700 miles away!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-accessing-a-dockerized-database-via-phpmyadmin-or-phpstorm&quot;&gt;2. Accessing a Dockerized database via PhpMyAdmin or PhpStorm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many useful tools available for interacting with a MySQL database. Since we’ve transitioned to &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/tag/docker/&quot;&gt;Docker for our local development&lt;/a&gt;, we prefer one of the following techniques for manipulating databases abstracted into the Docker container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;adding-phpmyadmin-to-a-docker-stack&quot;&gt;Adding PhpMyAdmin to a Docker Stack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phpmyadmin.net/&quot;&gt;PhpMyAdmin&lt;/a&gt; is a great tool that provides a useful interface for visualizing and interacting with a MySQL database. Here’s a simple method for adding the PhpMyAdmin service to a project’s existing Docker Stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build a container to run the PhpMyAdmin service:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Simply add this snippet to your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt; file
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;It uses the official &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;phpmyadmin&lt;/code&gt; image and defines the host as the database container (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mariadb&lt;/code&gt; in this example), so be sure to add it &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the section defining your database container.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/lightning-17q1-phpmyadmin.png&quot; class=&quot;blog-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;phpmyadmin container&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Add to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set the correct database user and password (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PMA_USER&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PMA_PASSWORD&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the containers are up you can visit the port specific url (for instance &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;example.site&amp;gt;:8001&lt;/code&gt;) to access your project-specific PhpMyAdmin interface! :tada:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-phpstorm-to-interact-with-a-dockerized-database&quot;&gt;Using PhpStorm to interact with a Dockerized Database&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another method is to connect PhpStorm directly to the database container using PhpStorm’s Database Browser. Instead of opening a shell into the container via the command line, this allows us to view DB tables and run SQL queries directly within the PhpStorm interface! PhpStorm even provides useful code completions when writing database queries!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To connect PhpStorm to your DB container:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In PhpStorm, go to the “Database Browser”, click the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; dropdown and select “Data Source &amp;gt; MySQL”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/lightning-17q1-pstorm1.png&quot; class=&quot;blog-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;phpstorm connect1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the popup window:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Map the project DB container’s port specified in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt; file to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Port&lt;/code&gt; (in the below example it’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;32770&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Add the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Database&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;User&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Password&lt;/code&gt; fields from the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt; file as well&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;You can select &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Test Conneciton&lt;/code&gt; or just &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;OK&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/lightning-17q1-pstorm2.png&quot; class=&quot;blog-image-full-width&quot; alt=&quot;phpstorm connect2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once connected, PhpStorm will display all the tables in a drop down in the Database Browser, which is useful for quickly glancing through all the tables! You’ll also be able to run SQL queries within PhpStorm and see outputted results without having to leave the interface! :star2:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/lightning-17q1-pstorm3.png&quot; class=&quot;blog-image-full-width&quot; alt=&quot;phpstorm connect3&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Write and save custom queries!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-using-apowersofts-free-screen-recorder-to-capture-your-screen&quot;&gt;3. Using Apowersoft’s Free Screen Recorder to capture your screen&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a picture’s worth a thousand words, than a video is worth…a million? There are times when it’s useful to send a short video (for example, a quick tutorial to a client) and Apowersoft’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apowersoft.com/free-online-screen-recorder&quot;&gt;Free Online Screen Recorder&lt;/a&gt; is a great tool for capturing your screen. It’s easy to use and there’s &lt;em&gt;no recording time limit&lt;/em&gt;!  Other things we like are the ability to customize the cursor appearance, limit the capture to a specific region of your screen, and specify the resulting video format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setup is incredibly easy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apowersoft.com/free-online-screen-recorder&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; and download the Launcher (you only have to do this once)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now anytime you want to record, just go back to the page and hit “Start Recording”!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*There is a Desktop version for those who prefer using the full application. However, the free desktop version limits recordings to 3 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wrap-up&quot;&gt;Wrap Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you find this quarter’s top picks helpful! Leave a comment if you have additions to share with us!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Five Drupal 8 Tips to Empower Content Authors</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Creating and publishing quality content within time constraints is a common challenge for many content authors. As web engineers, we are focused on helping our clients overcome this challenge by delivering systems that are intuitive, stable, and a pleasure to operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the architectural phase, it’s critical to craft the editorial experience to the specific needs of content authors to ensure the best content editing experience possible. Drupal 8 makes it even easier than previous versions for digital agencies to empower content creators and editors with the right tools to get the job done efficiently, and more enjoyably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our five tips to enhance the content editing experience with Drupal 8 are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#dont-make-authors-guess---use-structured-content&quot;&gt;1. Don’t make authors guess - use structured content&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#configure-the-wysiwyg-editor-responsibly&quot;&gt;2. Configure the WYSIWYG editor responsibly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#empower-your-editorial-team-with-quick-edit&quot;&gt;3. Empower your editorial team with Quick-Edit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#enrich-content-with-media-embeds&quot;&gt;4. Enrich content with Media Embeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#simplify-content-linking-with-linkit&quot;&gt;5. Simplify content linking with LinkIt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-dont-make-authors-guess---use-structured-content&quot;&gt;1. Don’t make authors guess - use structured content&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The abundance of different devices, screen sizes and form factors warrants the use of structured content. Structured content is content separated into distinct parts, each of which has a clearly defined purpose and can be edited and presented independently from one another according to context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How does that relate to a content editor’s experience?” - you may ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In years past, it was very popular to give content editors an ability to create “pages” using one big “MS Word-like” text box for writing their articles, news releases, product descriptions, etc. This approach produced content that was not reusable and was presented in one strict way. Who wants to navigate within one enormous text area to move images around?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though those days are long behind us, and even though we all know about the importance of structured content, sometimes we &lt;em&gt;still fail&lt;/em&gt; to utilize the concept correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drupal was one of the first Content Management Systems (CMS) to introduce the concept of structured content (node system - Drupal 3 in 2001). In fact, Drupal is no-doubt the best CMS for implementing the concept of structured content, but its ability to provide a good content authoring experience lagged behind this solid foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, in Drupal 8, editing structured content is a joy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the WYSIWYG (&lt;strong&gt;W&lt;/strong&gt;hat &lt;strong&gt;Y&lt;/strong&gt;ou &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;ee &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;s &lt;strong&gt;W&lt;/strong&gt;hat &lt;strong&gt;Y&lt;/strong&gt;ou &lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt;et) editor and Quick Edit functionality in Drupal core, we can equip our content editors with the best of class authoring experience and workflow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the difference between unstructured and structured D8 content below. Instead of only one field containing all text, images, etc., the structured content stores each definitive piece of information in it’s own field, making content entry fast and presentation flexible!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/structured-vs-unstructured.jpg&quot; class=&quot;blog-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;Structured vs unstructured content&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-benefits-of-drupal-8-structured-content-approach&quot;&gt;The benefits of Drupal 8 structured content approach:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The author clearly understands where each piece of information should reside and does not have to factor in markup, layout, and design while editing (see &lt;a href=&quot;#configure-the-wysiwyg-editor-responsibly&quot;&gt;tip #2&lt;/a&gt;). Content entry becomes remarkably efficient and allows the author to concentrate on the essence of their message instead of format.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The publishing platform is easier to maintain while supporting system scalability.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The modular nature of structured content makes migrations between CMS versions or to a completely different CMS much more streamlined. &lt;em&gt;A huge plus for those long-term thinkers!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-configure-the-wysiwyg-editor-responsibly&quot;&gt;2. Configure the WYSIWYG editor responsibly&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drupal 8 ships with WYSIWYG text editor in core. The editor even works great on mobile! In a society that is so dependent on our mobile devices - who wouldn’t like to be able to quickly edit a missed typo right from your phone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drupal 8 provides superior enhancements to the UX (User Experience) for content authors and editors out of the box. However, with a little configuration, things can be further improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When establishing the UI (User Interface) for content authors, site builders should focus on refining rather than whole-sale adoption of the available features. Customizing the WYSIWYG editor is the perfect example of subtle improvements that can immediately make a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WYSIWYG text editor is an effective tool for simple content entry since it does not require the end user to be aware of HTML markup or CSS styles. Many great functions like text formatting options (font family, size, color, and background color), source code viewing, and indentation are available at our fingertips, but as site builders we should think twice before adding all those options to the text editor toolbar!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With great power comes great responsibility! Sometimes, when you give content editors control over the final appearance of the published content (e.g. text color, font family and size, image resizing, etc.), it can lead to an inconsistent color schemes, skewed image ratios, and unpredictable typography choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we help our content authors in avoiding common design / formatting mistakes? Simple!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use a minimalist approach when configuring the WYSIWYG text editor.&lt;/strong&gt; Give authors access to the most essential text formatting options that they will need for the type of content they create and nothing more. If the piece of content edited should not contain images or tables - do not include those buttons in the editor. The text editor should be used only for sections of text, not for the page layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A properly configured CMS should not allow content editors the ability to change the size of the text or play with image positioning within the text section or the ability to add H1 headers within auxiliary content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is an example of a bad vs. good WYSIWYG configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/good-vs-bad-wysiwyg-editor.jpg&quot; class=&quot;blog-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;WYSIWYG editor configuration compared&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;benefits-of-the-minimal-thoughtful-wysiwyg-configuration&quot;&gt;Benefits of the minimal (thoughtful) WYSIWYG configuration:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Easy to use&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Less confusion (though there are edge cases, most editors don’t use all the buttons)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Better usability on mobile devices&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Less risk of breaking established website design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s keep our content editors happy and not overcrowd their interfaces when it’s absolutely not necessary. It is our duty as software engineers to deliver systems that are easy to use, intuitive, scalable and uphold design consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-empower-your-editorial-team-with-quick-edit&quot;&gt;3. Empower your editorial team with Quick-Edit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/quick-edit/overview&quot;&gt;The Quick Edit module&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most exciting new features that is included in Drupal 8 core. It allows content authors and editors to make updates to their content without ever leaving the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The days of clicking “Edit” and waiting for a separate page to load just to fix a tiny typo are gone! The Quick Edit module eliminates that extra step and allows content editors to save a great deal of time on updating content. As an added bonus - content editors can instantly see how updated content will look within the page flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the Quick Edit functionality in action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/quick-edit-demo.gif&quot; class=&quot;blog-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;Quick Edit module demo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;quick-edit-configuration-tip-for-back-end-and-front-end-developers&quot;&gt;Quick Edit configuration tip for back-end and front-end developers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make use of the Quick Edit functionality within the website pages, entities have to be rendered on the page via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/api/entity-api/display-modes-view-modes-and-form-modes&quot;&gt;View Modes&lt;/a&gt; and not as separate fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This restriction presents a challenge when there’s a needs to provide Quick Edit functionality for a page constructed by the Views module. More often than not, Views are used to single out and output individual fields from the entities. The most used Views formats are “Table” and “Grid”. They currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/node/1962606&quot;&gt;do not support Quick Edit functionality for usability reasons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A workaround for this issue is to use the custom View modes for Entities and create custom Twig templates for each View mode that should be outputted by Views in order to accommodate custom layout options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-enrich-content-with-media-embeds&quot;&gt;4. Enrich content with Media Embeds&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the era of social media, content editors can’t imagine their daily routine without being able to embed their Tweets or videos into the stories they publish on their sites. In Drupal 6 and the early days of Drupal 7, it was pretty challenging to provide this functionality within the WYSIWYG editor. Developers had to configure many different plugins and modules and ask them politely to cooperate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Drupal 8 Media initiative has placed the content author’s experience and needs at the forefront of community efforts. As a result, we have access to a great solution for handling external media - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/ckeditor_media_embed&quot;&gt;CKEditor Media Embed Module&lt;/a&gt;. It allows content editors to embed external resources such as videos, images, tweets, etc. via WYSIWYG editor. Here’s an example of the Tweet embed – the end result looks beautiful and requires minimal effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;If you&amp;#39;re going to build a new site, build it in D8.&amp;quot; - someone who knows what they&amp;#39;re talking about quotes &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jrbeaton&quot;&gt;@jrbeaton&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TriDUG&quot;&gt;@TriDUG&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/8w9GAuuARu&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/8w9GAuuARu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Savas Labs (@savaslabs) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/savaslabs/status/824770016507752448&quot;&gt;January 27, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all this media goodness available to us, there is no reason why we shouldn’t go the extra mile and configure the CKEditor Media Embed module for our content authors!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-simplify-content-linking-with-linkit&quot;&gt;5. Simplify content linking with LinkIt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linking to content has always been a clumsy experience for content editors, especially when linking internally within the same site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was always the risk of accidentally navigating away from the page that you were actively editing (and losing any unsaved information) while searching for the page to link to. Also, the default CKEditor link button allowed editors to insert a link, assign it a target value, title, maybe an anchor name, but that was about it. If the link to the internal content changed, there was no way for the page to update and links throughout the website would end up broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s not put our content editors through that horrible experience again. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/linkit&quot;&gt;LinkIt module&lt;/a&gt; for Drupal 8 to the rescue!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the LinkIt module the user does not have to copy / paste the URL or remember it. LinkIt provides a search for internal content with autocomplete field. Users can link not only to pages, but also to files that are stored within Drupal CMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new and improved linking method is much more sustainable, as it recognizes when the URL of the linked content changes, and automatically produces the correct link within the page without the need to update that content manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/linkit-file-link-demo.gif&quot; class=&quot;blog-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;LinkIt File link demo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Linking to files with LinkIt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My personal favorite feature of the LinkIt module is the flexible configuration options. The LinkIt module makes it possible to limit the type of entities (pages, posts, files) that are searchable via the link field. You can also create a custom configuration of the LinkIt autocomplete dialog for each WYSIWYG editor profile configured on your site. Plus, it is fully integrated with Drupal 8 configuration synchronization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As site builders, there are many improvements that we can make in order to &lt;strong&gt;streamline the process of content authoring&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the right mix of forethought and understanding, Drupal 8 allows web engineers to deliver content publishing platforms that are unique to the client’s specific needs, while making web authoring a productive and satisfying experience.&lt;/p&gt;
