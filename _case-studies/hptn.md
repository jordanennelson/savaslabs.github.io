project_highlights: [Responsive web design, UX design, Drupal 8, Client server integration]
project_objective: |
  For the redesign, HPTN prioritized providing their users with a clean, modern site that loads easily on mobile devices in areas of the world with less-than-optimal bandwidth, and to provide their content editors with a powerful, easy-to-use content management interface. They also needed to connect with their Microsoft SQL server to pull data on studies, study sites, publications, and network members.
project_process: |
  Working with HPTN stakeholders, Savas Labs created a responsive design that would best serve each of HPTN's user groups, especially those accessing the site on mobile devices, and implemented that design in a custom Drupal 8 theme. Savas Labs heavily relied on Drupal content entities to pull and display data coming from legacy HPTN systems, and leveraged both Drupal and external caching mechanisms to ensure prompt delivery of requests to end users.
project_results: |
  Thanks to an integrated approach in which Savas Labs worked closely with the client, the new site launched in time for the HPTN Annual Conference, the ongoing maintenance and administration of the content decreased dramatically, and both the corporate site maintainers and the remote users reaped the benefits of the easily navigable, mobile-friendly delivery of data.
