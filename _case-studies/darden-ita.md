project_description: |
 To secure their place as one of the country’s top business schools, the Darden School of Business sought to redesign and rebuild their web properties in Drupal 8. Partnering closely with peer agency Viget on design, Savas Labs consulted during the design process and built the new Drupal 8 site. Main points of focus for us were:
- Ensuring site and content architecture would sync well with Drupal and would provide content editors with a powerful ability to create unique content.
- Creating an intuitive and powerful user experience for content editors, who were all new to Drupal 8, to empower them to use the new tools at their disposal to create dynamic, engaging content in a streamlined manner.
- Training the Darden staff on Drupal 8—a flexible and powerful tool— efficiently and effectively.
- Integrating Viget’s front end code into Drupal, which involves taking their static templates and translating them into Twig, Drupal’s templating language, which is how we enable the templates to be dynamic (changing when the content changing). We have to configure the Drupal backend to pass us data in the format we need it in (e.g. a date in the proper format, or a piece of content that’s featured on another page in a certain format), then get everything to output on the page properly.
- Coordinating content migration. We used an agency to do the actual migration from Wordpress.
